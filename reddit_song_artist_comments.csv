Like Hot Rats is mostly instrumental, but it's reasonably complex instrumentation and arrangement so your opinion of it may change depending on how in the background it is. By contrast In Utero is pretty straightforward rock so it'll either catch your attention or it won't. And Mezzanine is just chill. You should start with that tbh.

Apple,Charli XCX,all,1ktp0vo,When is the line drawn between “industry plant” and “successful promotion?”,mtvpzql,Loves_octopus,"Industry plant is often, stupidly, just associated with an effective marketing campaign. I do think it’s dishonest to present yourself as indie when you’re packed by big label marketing $$, but it doesn’t make you an industry plant. 

It also doesn’t make you an industry plant just by having wealthy parents (not in the industry) that support your interest in music. Again, it might make you dishonest or inauthentic, whatever that means, if you present yourself as coming from nothing but actually came from significant means, like Kid Rock, the Strokes, or Taylor Swift. 

It starts to edge into industry plant territory when close family members are big in the music or entertainment industry. Clairo is a good example of this, her father’s executive connections directly led to her getting signed onto a record deal. 

To me, a *true* industry plant is an artist who is selected by an industry member and specifically crafted into a hitmaker. The label might put together the band, dictate their aesthetic, have a team of professional writers to write the songs. Basically the label has creative agency over the brand rather than the artist. IMO that is what makes a true industry plant. It’s basically impossible for me to give solid examples because there’s no way of knowing for sure, but that’s my definition. I guess the clear examples would be most boy/girl bands from the 90s and 00s. This was common in the 60s too with bands like the Monkees.",6,2025-05-23 18:33:19

There is some legitimate version of it, especially in the nepo baby context. People like Sabrina Carpenter or LMFAO who have backing and label support from the very beginning. It's also fair for people like Cardi B and Latto who came off of TV Shows and were cast rather than making it through traditional avenues.

The Strokes were never really criticised for being *industry plants*, cause the bidding war was pretty public and came *after* they already established a lot of hype with their first EP. They were mostly criticised for not being ""real"" and basically being *nepo babies* cause they were rich connected kids who were dabbling in punk and garage rock. But nobody cared they were rich cause the music was good and they seemed genuine.

With Charli XCX, nobody really accused her of being an industry plant cause most people know some of her work from the last 15 years.

Ok, if the person or band who is successful has breasts, they are an industry plant. If the person or band who is successful doesn't have breasts, they are stars who defied the odds, and clawed their way to the top from their upper east side private schools purely on the strength of their own merit.

Seriously, though, there is no such thing as an industry plant. There are people that have wealthy and influential parents--like Gracie Abrams, Julian Casablancas, the Beastie Boys --who can help fund their children and call in favors, which gives them a better chance. But, the dirty secret in music--especially punk--is that most of the artists are from upper middle class families, despite the way they present themselves. As far as the music business goes, it's a business, and 99.999% of the time if a record exec has to choose between the next Mozart who may not make any money but will get great reviews, a Nickelodeon star who already has 8 million followers, or someone from a trailer park who is killing it on Tik-Tok, they are going to back whoever it is that business logic tells them will make the most money. And, when they do, it's their job to promote the hell out of them. All these claims of an artist being an industry plant just means that the record company is doing their job.",2,2025-05-23 19:11:20

That being said, I'm glad the discussion hasn't been sidetracked by the, ""industry plant means you think they don't have talent,"" red herring. It simply means that marketing has taken one of many in the stable and made them bigger than the others--most likely because they are marketable for reasons other than music. All the musicians the industry chooses from for this action will be talented enough to be in the pool they would choose from. So that argument is moot.

If anyone thinks Taylor Swift is an industry plant, they can make a good case for it. But what they then need to do is admit that she took on the role of industry and marketing herself, which is why she has soared to the levels she has.

""industry plants"" just aren't a thing. The term has just become a much easier way for people to express either 1.) how phony and artist seems or 2.) skepticism towards an artist's relatively fast rise to prominence, both of which have been a part of the wider music industry since its inception.

I think the reason why the term comes up more now is because of how blisteringly fast an artist can legitimately ""blow up"" due to social media. So, from a cynical, outsider's perspective, it's easy to say, ""Pfft, this *must* be getting propelled by major labels banding together to inject someone into the industry,"" and it's just never the case.

And hell, even in cases when an artist blows up *immediately* out of the gate via a major label... that's literally just the label doing its job lol.

The Strokes performed in NYC for around a year and a half as they honed their skills and wrote material for their debut.

Then they released The Modern Age EP in January 2001 - this was really what made their big break. The NYC and London rock scene went crazy after them, the NMEs and Rolling Stones were writing about them, and major labels launched a bidding war.

By the end of the year they already got signed, recorded Is This It, and were fully supported by the label. They were doing a promotional world tour in Summer 01, so the hype was already there for them long before September.

Boy bands and precursor acts like the Monkees are the usual go to examples, but other bands are also on the borderline: the Byrds and the Lovin Spoonful, for example, were both formed with the cooperation of A&R people to create “folk rock groups”; LA singer-songwriters often had more fans among industry types than among regular people before they were given a chance to record albums with significant budgets.

Also on the borderline — even when a band does have an organic following to begin with, the marketing/promotion behind the scenes to take them to the next level often isn’t much different from the techniques used if you were going to build up a complete plant.",1,2025-05-24 10:08:22

The current number-one song on alternative radio is “God Needs the Devil” by Jonah Kagen. According to the credits on the single, Jonah’s signed to Arista Records, and he has around 3 million monthly listeners on Spotify…but there’s next to no readily-available information about him on the Internet.

- Doing a Google search, I found his bio from his old collegiate soccer team before I came across any mentions of him from any notable mainstream or alternative music publication.
- The music videos on Jonah’s official YouTube channel have received views in the hundreds of thousands to millions, but I can’t find any third-party videos of him performing with view counts above the low four digits. His media appearances appear to be limited to small-market radio stations.
- “God Needs the Devil” is a perfectly fine folk/alt-country song that slots in with artists like Noah Kahan or Zach Bryan, but those guys are massive in adult-alternative circles, and “God Needs the Devil” is nowhere to be found on AAA radio.
- What media I can find on Jonah Kagen suggests that his popularity is thanks to TikTok, but I don’t think that adds up. “Messy” is a recent number-one alternative hit whose popularity can be traced back to going viral on TikTok, but that song (and Lola Young) is **inescapable.** My local alternative radio station doesn’t play a lot of new songs outside of popular ‘90s-‘00s artists (and the new music bloc it airs in the evening slants toward AAA), and I had to search for “God Needs the Devil” on Apple Music, because it’s barely featured on any curated playlists.",1,2025-05-24 02:23:10

Nobody should be questioning if it deserves to be discussed at all. We should be discussing if it's good or forgettable and leaving it at that. 

At the end of the day, the sin being committed here is corporate, done purely to make money, art. This happens in all sorts of artistic venues and we as a populace just don't care. It's rampant in motion pictures across genres, stuff that isn't good but entertaining. Andy Warhol made illustrations for magazines to pay the bills, something visual artists do all the time.

That's very kind of you first of all :) And yes I hope and can see OBAA being a great crowd pleaser and having the broadest appeal of any of PTA's films so far and yes what you've described would the best case scenario for films lovers and cinephiles like us here on this subreddit. It does feel like his year and while nothing is a guarantee he seems like the safest bet this year given how beloved he is in the industry and how the academy must be itching to give him an Oscar coupled with his overdue narrative. 

And I agree that I, too, thought Villeneuve was a lock when I got out of seeing Dune Part 2 last year (my #1 film of last year), and I was deeply disappointed he wasn't nominated. He would have been my pick for best Director and reading between the lines I assume he very well might have been yours as well. And I agree also in that I would pick him above any of the five directors actually nominated (especially Jacques Audidard - easy swap but yeah). 

But I have to disagree with that parallel between PTA and Villeneuve, first of all the obvious: OBAA is releasing in September, unlike Dune, which released in March. But furthermore, PTA is much more consistent and reliable in that he keeps getting major nominations for films, including his last five, which is something that isn't really the case for Villeneuve. So, that is a major thing for me, and personally is a major factor on why I'm bullish on PTA and not really at this point worried he'll be 2025's Villeneuve. Hopefully that made some sense, since I think I rambled on lol.",1,2025-05-28 21:18:40

You can find similar albums on LastFM (I use the Similar Artists feature on that Website), I also use AOTY, music forums on Reddit, and obviously RYM, but I use LastFM as my main source on finding new albums.

I mostly listen to Rock, mostly Shoegaze, Indie, Emo, Pop Punk, Metal some Hip Hop, RnB, Drum and Bass, Soul.

My personal recommendations:

Failure - Fantastic Planet (This band actually played with Tool in the 90s)

Hum - You'd Prefer An Astronaut 

Helmet - Meantime

Megumi Acorda - Unexpectedly (If you like Dream Pop, you'll like this album)

Title Fight - Hyperview

They Are Gutting a Body of Water - s

Snot - Get Some

The Verve - A Storm In Heaven

Swervedriver - Raise (also listen to Mezcal Head by the same artist)

Catherine Wheel - Ferment

Kitchens of Distinction - Strange Free World

Sway - The Millia Pink and Green

Ozean - Ozean",1,2025-05-20 02:17:56

I can’t speak for **Katy** other than they came up at vaguely the same time; Katy’s major label debut was a few years earlier, but the retro-inspired blockbuster of Teenage Dream etc. was fairly big at around the time Lana debuted. 

**The Weeknd** is a frequent collaborator of Lana’s. 

I probably wouldn’t suggest most of these from a vague “similar to Lana Del Rey” prompt, but this all seems fairly typical for algorithm/AI generated popular recommendations.

Ive seen Autechre live four times, going on five, it will be the band I follow like a transfixed anthropologist or ornithologist finally catching a sight of a rare bird. when I hear them live im amazed to be a human just like them, the philosophical implications behind what they’ve figured out sound can do is truly magic.

It's like they made a video of all this because it's all sounds so insane that nobody would believe them if they didn't film it... but ok they filmed it... and it just comes off as so self-serving and self-obsessed.  But hey... I guess that's Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it ?

The more exposure I get to Levin and Gomez, the more I get why people are saying that this isn't an actual relationship but rather a business agreement (which is also 100% believable for Hollywood types).

Part of me feels like both of these two have had their minds warped by the industry they're in so much (and let's be honest probably a crapload of substance abuse) that this might be the only way they actually know how to act at this point.

Maybe Gomez and Levin are taking pointers from Warren Beatty's quote from the 90's Madonna documentary that Gomez wanted so badly to emulate : 

""She (Madonna) doesn't want to live off-camera, much less talk. There's nothing to say off-camera. Why would you say something if it's off-camera? What point is there existing?""",11,2025-05-04 05:38:22

“Selena had never been to a prom before,” Benny revealed on the Jennifer Hudson Show April 7. “So, I thought I’d throw us a prom for my birthday.”

So I got a question, what was it, a party for benny's birthday or was it a music video shoot?

They constantly put up cones trying to block said parking so theirs and their supplier delivery trucks have places to stop without actually paying for parking. This entire campaign is about protecting the deliveries. If you look at Google satellite photo the current image even shows such a truck blocking the curb lane and streetview shows the pylons.

Further to this, it’s not like they weren’t aware of this issue. If you streetview back to 2016 the building had a driveway to a ground level loading garage. When they got the building they specifically modified this to be the entry way to the current store. So they knowingly removed the buildings loading area in order to increase floor space. With the assumption they could instead block live lanes for deliveries without consequence.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER,Billie Eilish,all,1kybvqc,The latest Protect Bathurst post,mv26v5h,TorontoHegemony,"That’s true but Summerhill market has a central processing and cooking facility at Lawrence and the DVP. Where they make in house foods. They have a few stores in the city and in new market. They require at least delivery vans to get the items to the stores. For deliveries from other companies or suppliers, those companies have their own trucks of whatever size. They stop at multiple stores on the route. If I supply the store I might be able to have a truck stop at farm boy on DuPont, loblaws at Christie then fiesta farms also on Christie as they have actual loading areas. (Because they have given serious thought to how the business needs to operate) It is inconvenient and perhaps I get fines for stopping at summerhill. So it’s cheaper to use that big truck to hit those nearby stores on the same route. Or you could be like loblaws/metro and sometimes have your own central receiving area to create custom pallets to send on your own trucks to stores. Having the smaller vehicles like vans or bikes means much more cost to deliver which increases price. One big truck could hit all the summerhills in the city, but now this store might not make the cut.

This is perhaps unfortunate for them but it is not like something that is unknown or some unforeeen situation to them. Their original location in rosedale has a loading dock but their mount pleasant location does not. That mount pleasant location has been there several decades now and they have operated it perhaps 15 years if I recall. If you want to wager a guess how deliveries are handled at mount pleasant you would be correct. A quick street view and they do the exact same parking system there where they just park on the street. Now there is street parking there, but you can see they have a big truck from the central production facility. If in the future any word of bike lanes came up on mt pleasant they would respond exactly like the annex. 

Anyway the point is that every business should be thinking about stuff like this. The Mercedes dealership on Dundas east just assumed they could endlessly park blocking a road lane while unloading cars. Then came the bike lane and only now is it somehow terrible there is a bike lane there according to them. They also assumed they could just occupy our streets for free without consequence. 

I am not unsympathetic as I visit their annex store not infrequently, but they have operated grocery stores since the 1950s. Removing the loading area was clearly a gamble that didn’t pay off. It’s unfortunate for them, but is it so unfortunate that we need to delay tens of thousands of transit users daily to accommodate them? 

Also they still have a parking lot that could accommodate their truck literally 2 houses north of the Annex store, so they have options.

my point was that one single point could make the difference between 4 different positions on the chart, so using an early prediction as if it is a final prediction or to even imply that the window is closed is inaccurate.

now if it doesn't end up in the top 8 next week, don't come back here to tell me 'i told you so', because i'm not saying it will be top 8, i'm saying that using early predictions is inaccurate because of how much the final chart might end up differing.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER,Billie Eilish,all,1kwy4vm,Whats the point of Dual-Mono on the Mixbus?,mul5nv7,Dan_Worrall,"It's not really dual mono unless each channel is processing a separate mono signal. It's just unlinked stereo compression, where the gain reduction is allowed to be different for each channel. Unlinked compression might have a tendency to push panned signals back towards the centre, or cause parts to wander slightly in the stereo image, though not usually by very much in my experience. But unlinked compression can also enhance the phase differences between the channels (by reducing the level differences) which can increase the sense of space and depth. It's also possible to have partial linking. Personally I more often like my bus compressors unlinked than linked, but it's an aesthetic choice, neither way is incorrect, as you might sometimes see suggested.",95,2025-05-27 21:16:11
BIRDS OF A FEATHER,Billie Eilish,all,1kwy4vm,Whats the point of Dual-Mono on the Mixbus?,mul3g2v,b_lett,"Imagine you have something like a plucky arpeggiator panning around L to R that is pretty peaky. If you put a normal compressor on your whole instrument bus, it may compress the whole bus on each plucky arp sound regardless of where the pluck is L or R.

A dual-mono compressor would compress only L when the plucks hit on L and compress R when the plucks hit on R. This approach can allow you to tackle compression in the stereo field where needed, and it doesn't feel like it's pumping or sucking the whole stereo image down with it.

Another area could be like a drum set, where you have different elements panned around, but you want to tame the transients where they occur, and you don't want a hat on the L side to cause weird dips in a sustained cymbal on the R side.

To add to this idea of 'dual-mono' compression, a lot of modern limiters or other plugins may have a switch or mix knob for something called something else. So for instance, FabFilter Pro L 2 calls it 'Channel Linking' and iZotope Ozone calls it 'Stereo Independence'. You can crank these up high or low to adjust how your transients or sustain material gets limited, L vs. R separately or together. A good parallel blend somewhere in between could be a way to open up some life in your stereo image when limiting occurs without being too unmusical at either extreme.

I personally like to catch transients a little more linked as a lot of my hard hitting stuff is more center in the mix anyways, while I kind of like my sustained stuff to be more dual mono and wide in stereo, but that's taste.

TL;DR: Dual-mono compressors are a little more surgical, tackling compression where needed L vs. R, or Mid vs. Side. Some limiters call it something else, check any plugin's manual to be sure.",11,2025-05-27 21:05:01

BIRDS OF A FEATHER,Billie Eilish,all,1kwy4vm,Whats the point of Dual-Mono on the Mixbus?,mumba4c,kdmfinal,"Unlinked/Dual Mono versus Linked/Stereo are going to sound a little different, mostly in terms of how the middle of your track feels. Generally speaking, keeping things linked is the best way to make sure I don't get any major shift in energy from the middle when one side clamps down on something more than the other. I'd say 90% of the time I'm happy 100% linked on stereo bus compression.

Every once in a while, a track that has a really interesting/dynamic image feels cooler when I let the channels do their own thing. Even in those situations, I'll usually go to a compressor with variable link like the API 2500 or Pro-C2 and find a sweet spot around 50-60% to get the benefit of some movement while holding things together.

End of the day, if either mode is really messing up my mix I've got a bigger issue upstream to sort out. Reasonable, commonplace amounts of compression on the bus shouldn't be going crazy enough to throw things out of wack, regardless.

I like to think of it as ""how much symmetry do I want in the bounce of the track from left to right. Sometimes, a mix feels better with ""everyone jumping up and down in unison"" .. Sometimes, a more meandering dynamic picture feels better!

Don't get too in your head about it. If you hear your center image start to drift, check and see if you're getting more gain reduction on one side versus the other. Otherwise, don't sweat it!",3,2025-05-28 01:03:40

Pro Tools was designed to get audio engineers to adopt digital. It’s not that strange to adopt hardware lingo then. Which then gets adopted in plugins. When you watch YouTubers go through how engineers like Tchad Blake or Andrew Scheps work they often stress setting it up in dual mono. They don’t always stress that the purpose is to get unlinked behavior and that you’re processing a stereo source. So this gets a bit misunderstood. 

I was taught in the 90s on consoles and tape. I don’t think the studio I was taught in even had a a “real” stereo compressor, all were “dual mono”, two units in one. If someone came in with a stereo source like a drum machine, if you wanted to compress this you were taught to patch this to “each” compressors. Preferably you’d link them in order or get the same compression. I don’t really remember any of the teachers even using words like dual mono when teaching this. They taught when to use link and when not to, and why. 

With that said, this dual mono/linked interchanged terminology is something I guess we have to live with. I was taught a bus is a path part of the routing. Today people say drum bus about a track. Back when I learned we’d might bus the drums to a stereo sub group  to get parallel compression where we could use the compressor in dual mono if we wished. :P",2,2025-05-28 12:00:38

- Lead single: Boss
- 2nd single: Sledgehammer 
- 3rd single: Worth It


Boss vs Sledgehammer isn't super drastic probably, but personally it seems to me that Sledgehammer stuck more with the fandom: Boss has more views on YouTube but Sledgehammer has more streams on Spotify and it peaked a bit higher in the US Billboard Hot 100 at the time. The 3rd single, Worth It, was undeniably the most successful song in the album, by far.


Fun fact: there actually is a song called ""Reflection"" in the album, bit it wasn't extracted as a single.


Not-so-fun fact: a member (Dinah Jane) doesn't sing in the first two singles... When they finally chose a song where she sings, we have another member (Lauren) who doesn't in the 3rd single. So... Technically, only OT4 singles from this album.",31,2025-05-20 16:11:54

This was really my first introduction to Billie, as I had written her off before. This album is perfect, top to bottom. Concise, beautiful, great storytelling, even better production, this has everything I could want in an album. 

Now that I’ve listened to Billie’s discography, this is her magnum opus and I don’t think it will change. WWAFAWDWG changed the game for sad girl music, HTE opened doors for Billie to experiment with new genres, and this album takes the best of both worlds. 

As for individual songs, all of them are stunning. My least listened are probably LUNCH and THE GREATEST, but they are both phenomenal songs. I’m obsessed with the run of the last four tracks. I’m obsessed with this whole damn album. THE DINER is that girl tho, underrated af.",174,2025-05-17 04:48:54

BIRDS OF A FEATHER,Billie Eilish,all,1kokkxh,"A year ago today, Billie Eilish released ‘HIT ME HARD AND SOFT’",msrxugr,axendrale,"Can’t believe it’s already been a year. This album is still on my main rotation. 

On first listen, a lot of the singles stood out to me. Chihiro was my instant favorite and imo, the best song she’s released. I haven’t heard a song before that captures the feeling of that song. Mainly the production level that Finneas gives to it. 

After listening to it multiple times from front to back, you can see how much growth and depth both Billie and Finneas have had. As the album goes on, each song really does feel like it hits both hard and soft. It rides a good line between personal and relatable. The length of the album and songs feels just right. The vibe of this album is just so unique to me. Nothing I’ve listened to has really come close to it. 

This was also the first album I’ve bought the vinyl for. More as a collector item. It’s a top 5 album in my life personally so I know my bias for this album but so glad to have this music in my life.",39,2025-05-17 11:07:54

It’s some of the most beautiful music by a mainstream artist this decade, and if it weren’t for Cowboy Carter it would’ve been my personal Album of the Year (and even then it’s pretty close).

I think a big reason why I love this album is her improved vocals, she clearly has been working to make her voice stronger and it shows on songs like BIRDS OF A FEATHER, WILDFLOWER, and THE GREATEST. But she still keeps her incredible writing talent in tact. BLUE is absolutely stunning. It wraps the albums themes up perfectly, uses lines from every song to tell a coherent story, and then shifts into a powerful and gorgeous second half that quietly knocks the wind out of me every time I hear it.",19,2025-05-17 12:28:11

There’s just such a rich exploration of sound in this project without it feeling messy or disjointed. The writing on this is also fantastic, continuing the mature introspection from HTE and the VOCALS; I really never expected Billie to consistently go there with belting but I’m so glad she did. 

I find it interesting that she was a key proponent for the ‘sad girl’ whispery sound of the 2010s and she is now one of the few popstars that still belt in their music (hopefully this is a sign for others to stop applying that vocal trend to ALL of their songs). 

Overall, this was my AOTY for 2024. It’s so fucking good and I have absolutely no idea how she’s going to follow it up but for now, she can continue riding the coattails of this fantastic project.",11,2025-05-17 12:07:54

BIRDS OF A FEATHER,Billie Eilish,all,1kgwyeu,Hillary’s Book of Lies is on Simon & Schuster’s list of New Releases,mr2dx0s,Gelmom,"Even this description is full of lies! The only thing that is vaguely correct is saying that Hillary is the “star” of he TLC shit show, and that bar was set as low as is gets! Hillary is NOT a mother, and it’s not because she only gave birth to Carmen, there are plenty of adoptive parents, and parents that used surrogacy in the way it was intended, as a last ditch effort to have children, because they want to love, care for, and protect their kids! Hillary just gave birth once, and doesn’t seem to remember anything about labor and delivery, which makes me suspect a planned c section, or one of those emergency c sections, where general anesthesia was used, since she remembers nothing from the ONE time she gave birth! Real mothers don’t exploit and use their babies, toddlers, and children as human meat shields. Real mothers don’t post themselves mocking and making up lies about babies who are crying, in perilous situations, and who are scared, or because she doesn’t like the way they look! Real mothers do not physically, sexually, and emotionally abuse BABIES, and proudly post about it! I could go on and on, but the fact is that Hillary knows nothing about pregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding, (this sick fuck used her totally made up version of nursing, which to mami, means gagging babies with her non lactating nipples, while restraining them in painful, even dangerous ways, and posting about it, while the prop or props, struggle to get away and breathe), to SA the babies that she could no longer profit from! 

Hillary is also NOT a wellness expert, when she’s clearly high all the time, glamorizing ED, and making up strange exercises, that could actually hurt people. Her “prenatal exercises”, if done by ACTUAL pregnant women, could hurt the mother and their unborn babies! As far as healthy eating goes, mami restricts food from babies and toddlers, (especially her fake namesake, since “the baby” is hopefully the last one this monster is allowed to order), doesn’t seem to know how to cook even the most basic foods, and she glamorizes ED, because Hillary is too disordered, delusional, and drug addled to know what a healthy body looks like!

I just hope that after he loses all of the money he spent trying to make his disgusting, sadistic, pathological liar and predator of a wife happen, (for the umpteenth time), AB finally cuts her off, and gets the “tiny New Yorkers” away from her, before something truly tragic happens to one or more of them, since mami has demonstrated time and time again, that she doesn’t love them, and doesn’t care what happens to them!",14,2025-05-07 13:54:28

my point was that one single point could make the difference between 4 different positions on the chart, so using an early prediction as if it is a final prediction or to even imply that the window is closed is inaccurate.

now if it doesn't end up in the top 8 next week, don't come back here to tell me 'i told you so', because i'm not saying it will be top 8, i'm saying that using early predictions is inaccurate because of how much the final chart might end up differing.

But if you look deeper, the lyrics are a love letter. The entire song is about intimacy and emotional knowing. 

While the world is focused on gifts and grand gestures of the holidays, she’s saying “I don’t need any of that. I just want you.” And not in a vague, cheesy way-she knows them. 

She understands what would make them feel loved and seen, and wants to show them how much she cares. That’s the heart of the song: not Santa’s magic, but the quiet magic of real love.

It’s not about holiday wish lists, it’s all about being the one who knows them best. That’s what makes this song so romantic!",27,2025-05-27 19:51:24

Espresso,Sabrina Carpenter,all,1kuzabn,This is iconic?!!!,muncgcl,potatoperfume,"Any random person can see the white female icons she cosplays. I made a post about how much she copies Bardot all the time. This isn't about her overall style. It's about, what is clearly stated in the original comment, the mv for please 3x.


The example given looks ""80s"" cause that's the time frame. Pic is actually the 90s though. But let's say it is. It clearly isn't just an ""80s"" asthetic. If you were to look at makeup from the 70s for French film stars it's . . . gonna look 70s. Perfect example is when Sabrina copies Bardot. I didn't know she was copying her cuz I didn't know Bardot before but I could tell what decade. But if you're someone who knows what they're looking at you can tell it's a knock off from French cinema from that time or more specifically Bardot.


Bollywood makeup looks different depending on the era. Makeup isn't done like that anymore. This is more of an ""old school bollywood"" 80s/90s which is what I said she did. There's a trademark way of accentuating the eyes and lips including what colors. You can literally look up people trying to just copy the lip makeup.

The Karma music video was released nearly a full year before Espresso. 

The cup featured in the Karma music video is a full-sized (maybe even an oversized) latte. Espresso is traditionally served in a very small cup, and it would not be served with foamed milk to make latte art.

""Talking utter nonsense"" doesnt strike me as an intentional reference either. If Taylor sang ""you're just talking nonsense"", I would be on board. That phrase fits the meter. Taylor could have simply used that lyric if that was her intention. But just the single word ""nonsense""......it's a hard point to argue.",18,2025-05-24 18:26:51

Espresso,Sabrina Carpenter,all,1kt8hca,The nonstop Sabrina (and others) hate makes discussing Primavera feel so toxic,mtsw6iz,Mysterious-Ad-5708,"In terms of her or anyone else's music I completely agree, there's space for everything at Primavera Sound and part of the joy of it is exposure to stuff you wouldn't normally listen to, curated by people who mostly know their shit (compared for instance to the totally random choices made at the more recent Reading/Leeds festivals for instance). I've been frustrated by people being so down on Central Cee too. maybe Pitchfork aren't as keen but Band4band and Sprinter are two of the rap anthems from the last few years alone, and if it's his subject matter, well there's been tons of other rappers with questionable views on.

In terms of fandom, I think there's been a bit of a shift in fan culture in recent years which people who are not used to, or into, this are having trouble understanding or adjusting to. Part of this is not understanding the zeal to be right at the front, seemingly in order to catch eye contact with the performer - I'm not trying to be rude here because I know this means a lot to some people, but it just feels totally alien to a lot of us. And with that, the queueing for hours before the festival opens, trying to be on the barriers for the entire day til your act comes on, is not something that's happened much at festivals in the past (it has at solo gigs obviously) - among other things it seems quite a dangerous thing to do health-wise! This is exacerbated by social media clips of people quite literally ignoring a band/act in favour of watching box sets on their phone/texting/reading/talking. I appreciate the majority of people are way more considerate but it does make the non-committed a bit worried about the overall vibe of what is meant as you say to be an inclusive music festival, encouraging new discoveries. equally though I understand that typically this sort of experience - of being close to the idol - is out of financial reach for a lot of people for the solo gigs so i do kind of get it. 

I think the scheduling has actually been quite sensitive with this in mind for Primavera which is a good thing.",10,2025-05-23 08:37:54

I've been going to primavera for 18 years, I'd be happy to see Sabrina or any pop acts at a different festival, but I don't want one of the most diverse festivals in the world to become dominated by a genre which already has the world's biggest platform. I know there are less rock headliners emerging and primavera has to move with the times, so it's not surprising, but it could do with more balance. 

Especially with the slightly weird timetable this year, with so many clashes of similar artists, I think there are going to be massive crushes and dead spots with less to do. I'm sure it will be great nonetheless, and I hope everyone who goes loves it.",12,2025-05-23 07:04:10

I don’t think anybody hates Sabrina or their fans, PS is a very open minded festival but I, personally, hate people camping in mordor and the attitude of not even caring about the other artists performing there because you just paid the ticket for one artist.

Espresso,Sabrina Carpenter,all,1kse9a2,Todd in the Shadows ranked Juno as the 4th best hit song of 2024.,mtqd0gc,Kooky_Bodybuilder_97,"I love Todd. Been watching him for probably over a decade. Since before he was forced to upload to YouTube at least. Have no idea where you got that he’s in his 50s. I dont actually know his age but I’d assume mid to late 30s max. He isn’t a music critic or journalist nor does he claim to be, he just enjoys pop music and gives his opinion on what’s current 

That being said, I did rme at his little blurb about her. It sounds like this is probably his only exposure so doesn’t realize how curated the image is, just thinks she’s believably hot. I actually like the song, but the message is ew. 

This isn’t really the series he takes time to asses the actual artist tho. So only mentioning image and production is fine. If this was the only thing he took away from her after doing a full pop song review, then that would be disappointing",0,2025-05-22 21:57:08

It was also the first time I paid attention to a Sabrina Carpenter song and was creeped out by the whole persona. That particular video just annoyed me on a very visceral level lmao. 

I could never take him seriously either. He has a few good takes, but he’s less of a music critic than he is a mouthpiece for the opinions of the mediocre, self-unaware Everyman. IMO, the video is a good example of the insidiousness of SC’s appeal.",5,2025-05-22 16:39:56

and that's just it. music preference is irrational. give me a million reasons and one more for the road for why they're good, and those songs still make me feel the exact same when i hear them.

the appeal of art is designed to by pass reason, so trying to justify preference with reason is trying to light a swimming pool on fire. unless i have real technical insight to those songs then my opinion boils down to ""i hate them because i hate them because i do.""

Jim is doing a great job with London Centric, covering stories that are often not covered elsewhere, or covered only superficially. I have no association with LC, other than as a happy subscriber. As he's noted elsewhere, a big chunk of each story is available with no paywall - enough to get a pretty good understanding of what's going on. This is quality journalism and it ain't free, folks. At under £8 for a monthly subscription, I reckon it's good value for money.

This sub has a long history of posts complaining about pedicabs (or rickshaws as some prefer to call them), and Jim's article provides some insightful background to how the situation has arisen and how it may develop.

Espresso,Sabrina Carpenter,all,1kmae4i,London Centric on pedicabs,ms8swy3,londoncentricmedia,"I totally understand the gut reaction but perhaps a bit of transparency on the business model might help? 

In this case the paywall (which comes after a large chunk of the article is made available for free) funded the costs of sending freelance journalists out for multiple nights over several months to talk to drivers, to try to piece together what was going on, track down pedicab garages, and convince drivers to open up and discuss the issues in a frank and honest manner. Then there's paying professional photographers to licence images and other costs. Then sometimes I pay a lawyer to read it and make sure I don't get sued, then sometimes I pay a lawyer when I do nonetheless get sued. London Centric articles like this one aren't dashed off — they take weeks and the total costs of each piece can easily be in the thousands of pounds, with the whole operation being run on a shoestring with none of the overheads of a big corporate news group. 

I just think it's worth spelling out why I'm doing it this way and it's totally fair enough to maintain the pox.... Another, totally legitimate, option is reading reprinted press releases or unsourced opinion on a local news website so covered in adverts that it crashes your browser.",35,2025-05-14 10:01:13

Fuerza’s album was also a return to form for corridos and while the ultra purists were not fully happy with the effort, new fans love it. It’s got a great blend of experimental and traditional sounds. Lyrics were lackluster but overall a solid album. I am still surprised it outsold Genesis by Peso Pluma.

Another favorite that gets me into a more fun/active magical mood is 'voodoo', and 'voodoo too' by Godsmack.  Both just have a great rhythm to sing along to.  Not-quite but almost a chant.

Though if I'm needing something more aggressive, there's always the doom 2016 soundtrack.  Pure heavy sound I like to refer to as Audio Adrenaline.",12,2025-05-12 02:19:46

*Billboard's Hot 100 has recurrence rules to ensure the chart remains dynamic and features new music. Specifically, a song is moved to ""recurrent"" status, meaning it's removed from the chart, if it: 1) spends more than 20 weeks on the chart and falls below position 50, or 2) spends more than 52 weeks on the chart and falls below position 25. These rules were implemented in 1991 and have been updated over time. Elaboration: The 20/50 Rule: If a song has been on the Hot 100 for 20 weeks and then falls below position 50, it is removed from the chart. The 52/25 Rule: If a song has been on the Hot 100 for 52 weeks and then falls below position 25, it is removed from the chart. Purpose: These rules aim to keep the Hot 100 fresh and feature a mix of current hits and emerging artists. Re-entry: A song that has been moved to recurrent status can potentially re-enter the Hot 100 if it gains enough chart points and there's a significant reason for its resurgence, according to Billboard.*",13,2025-05-29 23:20:55

I had something *sort of* similar: I was in a doctor's office getting an extensive new patient exam, when the nurse and I start hearing birds chirping. I thought it was odd, but didn't think too much of it. It was an integrative/functional medicine doctor, so maybe it was something they played for relaxation in that room? 

Anyway,, it stopped after a bit. When it started again 5 minutes later, I assumed it was an alarm on the nurse's computer... until she looked a little exasperated and asked me to please turn it off. I was so confused. 

I dug into my bag, and sure enough, an alarm on my phone was going off! I have no idea when I changed the afternoon ""take pill"" alarm to birdsong, but I must have LOL! It was surreal before getting embarrassing!",5,2025-05-29 12:26:38

Em influenced most of those artists and has an insane legacy despite how much modern hip hop fans will fail to try and smear it lol. Drake hasn’t had a good album since views n even that was just TDOSS level n he got way less hate with way lower highs and lows till the kendrick beef. He didnt basically carve his own subgenre of rap and influence an entire generation of rap either. Ab Soul been mid af since his first album n hes looked at as a god just off his rapping but like 50 year old way better discography em cant get that treatment? 50 Cent has sucked ass since his first album that em straight up produced and hiphop heads will try the best to fit in actin like he a higher tier.

Eminem always brings lyrics, wordplay, and flow and there’s always at least some tracks that are heat. If you claim it’s “all dog shit” then it just seems massively disingenuous and agenda-like to always act like it’s bad…many times I’ll find opinions being given on his work by people who never even listened to give it a chance. Some also judge it with inconsistent standards that will not be applied to other artist’s in the same way. This tends to happen to artists when they’re as big as Em. Extreme negative opinions to outweigh what those people see as overboard praise. To discount lyricism and wordplay so heavily is just shocking from anyone purporting to be a hip-hop/rap fan. If you’re not a fan, I don’t see how you could give a rating below average at least. Average seems much more fair. (I’m not speaking about the win of these random awards btw…of course it’s odd to have him win).

If Luther beats Old Town Road, it not only is the longest #1 run by a rapper but it becomes the longest running #1 song of all time.

I don't know if they'll be able to do it, but that would be insane.  The Grand National Tour is still running in the North America until June 18th and then continues in Europe until August 9th, so while I believe the tour is probably helping to keep the run going, I don't know if it will keep it going to break the all time record with just 4 weeks left in North America.  The Grand National Tour rumored to continue in Australia in the Fall and Kendrick could always release a Deluxe at any time to keep the momentum going, so who knows.

Not Like Us,Kendrick Lamar,all,1kobt8v,a Christian's thoughts on the Hebrew Israelite talk on DAMN.,mspdmvk,Defiant-Fix2870,"To be fair (and as a white female raised in an evangelical household) I personally see American Evangelical Christianity as a hate group.  They are actively working to take away the equal rights of others, abuse is rampant, and some have completely intertwined Christianity with white supremacy.  Personally I left the religion soon after becoming an adult for these reasons.  Specifically after witnessing abuse toward women and gay people.  I don’t see Jesus in most Christians I meet.  I sometimes wonder if they have even read the gospels and how they can act the opposite of him while calling themselves Christ followers.  That said, my landlords are both Christian pastors and are wonderful loving people.  I don’t think all white Christians are bigots.  I just think when you mix religion with politics, it poisons the religion.  From what I’ve read of Hebrew Israelites, they are also on a continuum ranging from harmless to active hate. 
Kendrick is a storyteller not a Hebrew Israelite.  Even if he were, I think it’s pretty clear that Kendrick is not a bigot.  That song is about Carl, and he has confirmed in interviews the lyrics are not about himself.  Plus every song has to be taken in the context of the album themes.  In damn he explores the duality of his relationship with both God and Luce (the Devil).  If you haven’t listened to the dissect podcast album breakdown I highly recommend it.  It goes deep into the scriptures and how they relate to the album.  This might help you feel better about those two songs.",6,2025-05-16 22:32:54

I think many people are just now becoming familiar with all the ways Christianity has been twisted for evil purposes. The same way terrorist Muslims twisted their religious text to exclude people.

Mormons have racist as well as homophobic doctrines, so they are also classed as a hate group according to this.

The Southern Baptist Convention.  Some protestant branches.

So I don't think you were trying to argue that most churches are hate groups because you wanted to use an overly broad definition for the religious organization that has a problem with your existence.  But I'm fine with all of them being hate groups if you want to use that definition.

The point remains that yes, you can say that hebrew isralelites are a hate group based on that definition, and it would also be true to most other Christian sects.  I don't care if you agree with those other sects, I'm saying paint everyone with the same brush, and don't single out a religion that is hostile to you unless you are going to speak out against all the religions that are hostile to other demographics.  So go ahead and go to a Mormon's artist page, or a Christian musician's page and let them know that you like the music but don't like that the artist is a member of or supportive of a hate group, and then act confused why people don't want to engage with you.  Or go to the churches that preach racist or homophobic rhetoric and tell them they are bad Christians.   

I actually encourage you to question this from an objective space, why you are so upset with a group that is hostile to you, but have not used the same description for groups that are hostile to other people, and what can you do as person to help the people who are negatively impacted by those groups.

I think these comparisons and justifications are a reach, I don’t believe this logic applies. What Lorde said was weird and disappointing. But imo it was not wrong of her to think it. Still, she really should have used critical thinking skills to check herself on the implications and context to know that it wouldn’t be appropriate to say outloud, especially in a highly publicized goddamn rolling stone interview. This just makes abuse that Pamela likely wants to forget into a headline and piques public interest in watching the video. 

I’m also really appalled by your comparison with the nazi video. The purpose of that video was likely to show that evil beliefs such as nazism can be fallen into by normal people that are not evil in every aspect of their being. Which yknow, is like one of the most important things to never forget about the holocaust. I can’t imagine feeling sad at the death of nazis for any reason whatsoever, especially after seeing how they can offer humanity to one another but view jews and the other marginalized groups they literally committed genocide against as non-human. This is such an insanely inappropriate take given the current climate with the United State’s quick descent into full blown fascism and very clear alignment with nazism. And seeing this in the same list as Kendrick Lamar’s album is just highly offensive. I know you weren’t trying to compare the two directly, but putting them in the same vein of examples is aligning them. He is a black man that was exploring themes of racism, misogyny, transphobia - how it’s affected his life and how his views have changed. 

Sorry, I truly don’t believe in beefing with strangers on the internet like this anymore, but the fact that this was even posted and tolerated by the subreddit is blowing my mind. This is an attempt at a conversation about nuance with a complete lack of understanding of the nuance behind these topics. This level of parasocialism is not worth it. Lorde is not a perfect person, there is not justification for everything that she does, and this is an example of one of those things.

And it's being called para socialism, but you engage in the exact same behaviour just from the opposite end of the spectrum wherein your personal convictions regarding the consumption of media are imposed upon someone you do not know but because you align with the majority opinion, you feel just without an ounce of critical thinking.

 Edit: Also, your confidence in commenting upon a video you have never seen sums up this whole situation. You are commenting without consideration of nuance, everything is merely for your need for validation of your morals by other internet strangers. I doubt you listen to Kendrick like that as well. It's just pointless arguing with people like you though, so I agree this is stupid.",1,2025-05-16 23:47:02

It's joyful and happy. That is my whole point. Also your first point is only true about Mr. Morale and even then, saying homophobic slurs or featuring unapologetic abusers is not a reinterpretation of trauma. And my first example was of Nazis being Nazis. And Dancer in The Dark is literally an exhibition of Björk's trauma by the director which he imposed.

I just wanna say, fair warning, that if the judge allows it to be included, it seems to me to be actually so much stronger of a defense than anything UMG has filed so far. 

With that being said, I still think the argument relies on the audience having this nuanced understanding of the history of rap culture and whether or not Kendrick's lyrics were factual. And I think you have to balance that with how widespread UMG made sure these claims were. Does the ""this is just hip hop culture"" defense stand when the track is being played outside the confines of a rap battle and being heard on a worldwide scale by people who maybe aren't even rap fans?

Thank you, for having the courage to speak this out, cuz it needs to be said - why did the beef become about how light skinned Drake is? That sounds like the antebellum South, when both blacks and whites ostracized mixed race children, leaving then feeling completely alone in this country, torn apart by the ugly prejudices from two different sides of their own gene pool. I was a 90s kid. By the time Y2k hit, civil society had enough time to put the needless mayhem, devisiveness, and polarity of the Watts Riots, O.J. events in context. The general consensus was to proscribe to a new movement, one I still am an avid supporter of to this day - Post-Racialism. We could acknowledge our racial diversity, celebrating our own personal, distinct heritage, while at the same time living the concept that race was an incidental, not essential, characteristic. That is, race essentially doesn't matter, we are more alike than we are different, and any one person could achieve anything any other could, so long as they took the correct actions. In the past decade or so, we have seen prejudice raise its ugly head yet again, with the inculcated theologies of Interaectionality and Critical Race Theory scarring our National Education System,  and permeating interracial relations. These caustic, divisive hypothesese have caused incessant argument/infighting amongst Americans, be it theft, looting, rioting, and/or vicious acts of savagery.  From  intimidating, to brawling, to actual killing. This imbecelic, backstabbing, cowardly clout chasing troll is simply a conduit, a mouthpiece for those who want to divide the American People for power(divide and conquer).; A parrot, regurgitating tired, ignorant, and hateful tropes from his masters. Then those who have a vested interest in this repulsive game will invert and negate the truth, calling those who don't care about race racist.

To be clear, I don't agree with their overall conclusion because I don't think using ""it was a diss track"" as a shield defends against the idea that an audience might still take it as fact. In fact, reading further into their argument, some of their own examples kind of go against their conclusion.

For example, they quote the Eastern district of Pennsylvania and in their quote from the court, the judge says ""the party offering the evidence must demonstrate that the art is the artist's attempt to tell a factual story. The mere fact that an artistic expression resembles reality is not enough..."". The only thing is, you have multiple instances of Kendrick in his diss tracks telling the audience that Drake is lying and that Kendrick is telling the truth. So even in the other precedent they're citing, there's still an avenue by which lyrics may be taken literally. You also have public figures associated with Kendrick who also piled onto this idea that Kendrick was telling the truth and Drake wasn't.

I still need to read more in order to reach a final conclusion, but my overall point is that this document is at least better constructed in terms of its argumentation than UMG's filings were. That doesn't mean the argument doesn't have flaws, though.",9,2025-05-15 15:32:20

Rap lyrics(mostly black artist) are brought up in court more against them, where other genres like metal, rock, etc,(mostly white) are usually never brought up and are seen as artistic expression. While they are used in court, every trial involving the lyrics always had pushback. Ie Drake signing a letter to block lyrics from being used in court cases.

I KILLED MIKE LAWSON AGED 30 FROM BUFFALO BEHIND THE WALMART OFF DEL CRISTO DRIVE. 2:30AM WITH A GLOCK 19, MAY 30th ON FACEBOOK LIVE. I GOT MAD CAUSE HE DIDNT GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE. I DROVE A BLACK MERCEDES G CLASS MODEL YEAR 2025. VANITY PLATES THAT SAY “K1LL3R” YOU KNOW THE VIBE. I GOT A RIDE OR DIE BITCH THATLL GIVE A FAKE ALABI.

Then in court: “thats racist, how dare you use what I say against me in court!”

Just because it happens to be this one race snitching on themselves, doesn’t mean it’s racist. I think a more general “artistic license” argument makes sense. But if you say something in a song, it just gives the cops a reason to look into you, and if they find corroborating evidence or witnesses, those lyrics are being read in court 100%

Anyone who watched the superbowl performance thought it was terrible & im sure most people have not like us/kendrick fatigue by now. Especially if you listen to the radio because they play Luther more than any other song on there. Which also means someone is paying for those plays.

It’s not too far off to believe a good portion of these tickets were given away or people paid to be there. I mean there is a video of what looked like a older man (possibly homeless) dancing/grinding while reincarnated played.. Which again is odd.

Who is the demographic buying the tickets? I don’t think it’s kids or women. So maybe college students & who else?

Drake's compensation by his label is heavily based on his popularity. When he was at the top of the charts and racking up a huge stream count, his label had to pay him a ton of money.

When ""Not Like Us"" broke, his own label apparently joined the effort to tear down Drake's status in order to vastly reduce his compensation. Drake argued that this is a violation of the label's fiduciary duty to him, and this isn't a novel scenario - labels have been proven to use this trick with other performers. That's why Drake is suing his own label and agents, rather than K.Lamar.

I don't know how to assess the credibility of those accusations, but at least it reads differently than ""Drake sues Lamar over 'Not Like Us'"" or whatever.",22,2025-05-09 14:57:07

I took part in the fandom with my fan account and looking back, she and her team were very strategic about building the fan base into what it is. Taylor was very active with fans on MySpace/Tumblr/social media, would invite super fans to her house for album releases, and invite super fans backstage at her concerts. As a tween, I remember thinking I would one day be chosen, and that she did so much more for her fans than other celebrities (LOL). She claims to not be the one talking about her exes, but leaves all these hidden messages and “easter eggs” about them for her fans to find, fostering a false sense of friendship with her fans. And when her fans are crazy and tear others down, she’s never told them to quit the hate. The monster the swiftie fandom is… yeah it was built by taylor herself",20,2025-05-29 22:18:27

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kye5hu,I don't know what to put here but ya,mv0vo7u,vale_ee,"hello, fellow fan but exswiftie here  I get it, the fandom is so actually crazy that is horrible even call you a swiftie cause then people think you dox or shut up anyone who even dares to call out Taylor on her horrible, shady and sometimes disgusting behaviour, I dont hate her but she and the fans piss me off so so much 😭😭, its ok to be in fandoms, hell this snark is sort of a fandom,  its a community and its great to share and laugh but swifties take it too far. I love taylors music ( but not TTPD and partially midnights) I was a huge fun, but its even hard for me to be friends with  hardcore swifties to joke and laugh about mental illness cause taylor wrote ""I dream about jumping off of very tall somethings"" ( something like that, I dont know the lyric well). 
I do in fact thing she was the one who let the fans be this way... look at the barbz,  they act and tweet and dox and harrass cause nicki has never told them to stop. Taylor was the same, she even held secret sessions, she has never tell the swifties to stop harrasing, never said nothing when her fan base is being racist, supremacist and sexist. About the sexism, I also HATE how the same fans attack someone, again , dox and harass people cause ""if you dont like her, you are just sexist"" MEANWHILE, they are filling a bingo about who fling inspired that song, who experience is she talking about, who is the wrong guy and harrassing that said wrong guy while taylor encourages and stays silent: look at ariana when she got the new album out, people were already making theories and fabricating certain links to songs about possibly his ex husband and she call the fans out and even ask for them to stop doing that. On the other hand, taylor capitalizes of her life, even more her love life, she uses certain words and colors to refer to men in order for the swifties to decode, she has always done that, so to me it seems  illogical for her, her team and the swifties to almost beg the public to see her in other way : ""I am more than a love life"" ""you are just sexist"" "" I was just a girl partying"" . 
I am NOT saying all her criticism is fair, no, so many people are just, yes, being sexist.  But when you market yourself, your brand, your drama and your music to be all about men, change your style acording who that man you are dating and sell with that, I dont think you can expect people  to not see you as the girl who writes about ex boyfriends. As a fan, I KNOW taylor has many songs that are not about his boyfriends, so many good songs about being a woman and growing up, and be sad and partying and be happy and finding yourself. But the truth is, her persona revolves around men, that is not bad, that is how she has build her brand, THAT IS NOT BAD, but she and the fans cant really ask people of not having that opinion ( when even they do) and when, she was the one who BUILD that persona, that empire, and those toxic fans, she is the one who allowed this.",3,2025-05-30 06:27:45

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kye5hu,I don't know what to put here but ya,mv2ola7,yesimextra,"It’s very interesting to me to watch this all from afar because I’ve been a fan since the beginning. I’ve grown up with her. I’ve also grown apart from her. I’ve gotten married, started a career, *gone to therapy*, and etc. It’s gotten the point where I want to see the same growth and maturity in her that I’ve seen in myself and I don’t. I am 32. She is 35. She should be showing more maturity and growth than I, and yet she isn’t reflecting that in the way she continues to handle herself, her brand, or in the music “she” writes. I say “she” because as a chronic Reddit user I’ve seen some shit where allegedly she uses ghost writers and makes them sign NDAs and each of era was a result of a new group of writers. *ALLEGEDLY I don’t want tree coming for me I am a nobody*

I feel like it’s a very nuanced conversation. After reading the Scott email and realizing what we’ve been fed is a lie, it’s really eye opening to the fact we are being sold a brand and for whatever reason people keep buying into it. Why? I wish I knew. The fans from the beginning are getting wiser because we are getting older. That can only mean the “true stans” are teenagers without a job/life that are able to live chronically online. Why is that her continued demographic? Why would she not want to cultivate that relationship with her fans that are her age and have been with her from the beginning? I’m assuming it’s because we are a much smaller pool and there’s more money to be made by catering to the younger generation. 

“She” is still cultivating an environment that is very parasocial and a farce. I put she in quotation marks because I don’t even know that I believe it’s her as much as I do it’s her parents and/or management team who are running her brand. Going back to the beginning she rewarded online fans who had stan accounts and etc with responses on Tumblr, or invitations to secret listening sessions. Just recently you got higher in the Ticketmaster que with the points you earned from purchases in her merchandise store. If that doesn’t tell you she’s only out for your dollar then I don’t know what else could make it clearer. Choosing to believe this farce as an adult is whack and those that do need to honestly seek therapy and work on whatever it is that’s making them seek validation from someone who will probably never even know they exist. 

I wonder what a documentary on her in 20 years will reveal because I’m sure her NDAs will expire at some point or maybe her control will lessen enough people are no longer afraid to speak out.",2,2025-05-30 14:30:48

I’m not a fan of her like I like some of her old music like you belong with me and stuff, but that’s really it. I just think people glaze her so much. They act like she’s a new Mariah Carey or something. She’s literally just an alto-mezzo. Not that impressive. I never really understood what the hype was all about or how it really started but here we are. It’s honestly not even really Taylor’s fault other than the fact that she doesn’t say anything to her fans to make them stop, which is basically her encouraging it and allowing it. It’s disgusting.

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kunbu4,please help could i be lesbian or do i have so ocd?,mu41g60,den-of-corruption,"real talk, that kind of stuff on tiktok is *so* damaging.

if you struggle with OCD, i'm sure this isn't news to you, but *nobody* gets to tell you that you don't know what you do/don't like. similarly, no one gets to tell you *why* you do something. people can **suggest** things to you and you can consider those things, but it's actually shitty on the part of other people to speak like they're authorities on the inside of your head.

to take this example to something outside orientation, let's use tattoos. if i say 'i get tattoos because i think they're beautiful and worth the pain', then someone else tells me 'no, you're getting tattoos because you're self-harming', they're being incredibly presumptuous.

if it's helpful to use a little mantra, just remind yourself that the *actual* definition of being gay means *wanting to have sex and romance with a person of the same gender*. not being a fan of an artist, not thinking women are beautiful, not  dressing in clothes that *some* gay people also wear.

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kuna52,lesbian or so ocd?,mu34a6j,Forine110,"honey, please do not use tiktok for any serious advice like this. if you have no attraction to women, and only feel attraction towards men, then you're straight. both men and women can admire someone of the same gender's looks without being attracted to them. it doesn't make a man gay for saying ""yo nice muscles how much can you bench"" (i have no idea what men say to other men), and it doesn't make a woman gay for complimenting or admiring another woman.   
someone who is queer usually has some signs leading up to their realisation, whether or not they knew what they meant at the time. so for you, if you found yourself wanting to kiss other girls or fantasising about dating them but pushed those thoughts aside, that would be an indication that you might be bi or lesbian. but you're certainly not a lesbian if the only people you find yourself attracted to are men.

tiktoks like those are mostly jokes and play off of stereotypes, like music that queer people listen to a lot or common tropes in our community. they're not something you should actually take seriously though, it doesn't make you suddenly gay if you listen to chappell roan or whatever. 

also, the feeling of wanting to *be* them is something that a lot of trans women feel too, where we're envious of a cis woman's looks and wish we could be as pretty and as cool as she is, but that's a completely different feeling to attraction. gender envy is different to sexual or romantic attraction and sexual orientation.",3,2025-05-24 23:14:51

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kuna52,lesbian or so ocd?,mu36xw6,Salt_Machine1204,"Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this out — it was really thoughtful and helpful. I’m still figuring things out, and sometimes I get confused between admiring someone and being attracted to them, so your explanation really helped me understand the difference more clearly.

I also really appreciate you mentioning how TikToks can be more for jokes or stereotypes and not something to base serious identity stuff on — that actually gave me a lot of perspective.

Thanks again for being so kind and respectful in how you explained everything. It means a lot. 💛",1,2025-05-24 23:31:31
Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kuna52,lesbian or so ocd?,mu3bty3,Forine110,"of course, i'm here to help and if i have managed to help you understand yourself a bit better, then i will have achieved my goal 💕  
it can be hard to figure out the difference between admiration and attraction, it took me years to get as far as i have and i'm still working on it. it wasn't until i was 22-23 that i realised that a lot of the feelings that i thought were crushes i had on girls during my school years was actually gender envy and i had this really really intense desire to look like them, but i had never had a crush before so i had mistaken those feelings for romantic attraction. only 5-10 years later when i realised i was trans, did i also realise the truth about those feelings. i'm still not 100% sure what a crush feels like, but i think that's because i'm bi as fuck and just find everyone hot regardless 😭. but i do know what gender envy feels like now, and i'm sure you'll get a better understanding of the difference over time.

yeah, tiktoks can be great for introducing you to the potential of diving deeper into your identity, like ""hey, if you really struggle with focusing, time management, reading and sitting still, it might be a good idea to speak to a professional about adhd"", but it shouldn't be the source of all your information about adhd and the thing you diagnose yourself with (just using adhd as an analogy here). same goes for sexuality and gender, it can be helpful for giving you that push in the right direction, that ""oh shit, maybe there's something there, maybe i should think more about my identity"", but you shouldn't take anything as 100% certainty of your sexuality. *THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOUR SEXUALITY IS, IS YOU!! IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE IDENTIFYING AS STRAIGHT, AND YOU DON'T FEEL ANY DESIRE TO BE BISEXUAL OR LESBIAN, THEN GO WITH WHAT YOUR HEART IS TELLING YOU!!* 

as always, if you have any other questions, i'm here to help so feel free to ask away!",1,2025-05-25 00:02:25
Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kuna52,lesbian or so ocd?,mu3eiym,Salt_Machine1204,"Thank you so much — this really helped and gave me some peace. You’re right that only I can truly know my orientation, and honestly, I’ve never really had any signs that I wasn’t straight. I was in a two-year relationship with a guy, and after we broke up (which was really hard on me), I ended up talking to a lot of guys afterward — not because I was confused, but because that’s what I was drawn to. Even my parents and my therapist eventually had to sit me down and suggest I take a break from dating, because I was jumping into it so quickly.

Looking back, that whole experience honestly just reinforces for me that I’ve always known who I’m attracted to. I never questioned it — ever — until one comment suddenly triggered this intense anxiety and doubt. I’ve also dealt with OCD before, where I fixated on a completely different topic and spiraled in the same way, so this feels very similar. It’s like my brain latches onto something specific and won’t let go — not because it’s true, but because it knows it scares me.

Thanks again for taking the time to respond so thoughtfully. It really does mean a lot. 💙",1,2025-05-25 00:20:00
Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kuna52,lesbian or so ocd?,mu3hp44,Forine110,"im really glad you've been able to gain some perspective and understanding of yourself! it makes me so so happy to be able to help someone in that way!! at the end of the day, your experience is what defines your sexuality and it sounds like you're happy identifying as straight and that there's nothing to indicate otherwise, so stick with it if you're happy with it!

i understand and empathise with your struggles completely. i'm not ocd but i am neurodivergent and it's 'severe' enough that i am unable to work a 'normal' job, and i completely understand how it can cause you to doubt yourself and have those irrational fears based on something that you heard that you're not sure if it's a joke or if it's completely serious. i have autism and experience something similar - *im not saying you're also autistic, just that i have had a similar experience as an autistic person, many neurodivergencies can share experiences and signs, but the presence of one doesn't mean there's also going to be the other as well.* \- my mind will hyperfocus on something and blow it way out of proportion, which can lead to catastrophising and spiraling. You're not alone in that experience even if ours are caused by different things, and you're not in the wrong for having these feelings, you did exactly the right thing by asking people for help and advice when you were confused about something.

i wish you nothing but the best, and i'm always here if you want to talk 💕",1,2025-05-25 00:40:46

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1ku98p8,Guts de Olivia Rodrigo. Una critica casi 2 años despues de su salida.,mtzrvcb,mikeigartua,"Gracias por compartir tu análisis tan detallado del álbum ""Guts"" de Olivia Rodrigo. Se nota que tienes un buen conocimiento musical y aprecias los detalles en la producción y composición.

Es interesante observar cómo Olivia explora temas como la ansiedad social en ""ballad of a homeschooled girl"" y las inseguridades en ""Lacy"". Estos sentimientos son comunes y suelen manifestarse cuando vivimos demasiado en el futuro (causando ansiedad) o nos comparamos constantemente con otros.

La música tiene ese poder de conectarnos con nuestras emociones y ayudarnos a procesarlas. Cuando menciones ""Pretty isn't Pretty"" y su mensaje sobre la toxicidad de compararse con otros, toca un punto importante: estas comparaciones suelen alejarnos del momento presente, donde realmente podemos encontrar paz.

Recientemente hice un video en Instagram que habla sobre cómo la ansiedad refleja las áreas donde tenemos menos fe en nosotros mismos, algo que podría complementar tu apreciación de ciertas canciones del álbum. El video explica que cuando vivimos anclados en el presente, tanto la depresión (que surge de vivir en el pasado) como la ansiedad (que viene de anticipar el futuro) disminuyen naturalmente.

¿Qué otras artistas consideras que exploran temas emocionales profundos de manera similar a Olivia Rodrigo?

I'm really bummed about the conflict between Tyla and Mt. Joy, but I have to go with Mt. Joy because their live sets go way above and beyond their recorded stuff. On their recent tours they have been giving way more of a jam band presence, playing 3 hour sets with no opener and jamming a lot from their songs into covers of great songs from Grateful Dead, to Frank Ocean, Gorillaz, Drake, to name some covers I've seen.

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kr96fh,Why does everyone assume Taylor Swift isn't problematic?,mtcyrng,hopefulocto,"probably just bc she is popular and always pretends to be an angel idk, they def fall for the character she plays as a hopeless relatable romantic that’s always the victim with zero nuance  every relationship. Not to mention she only pretends she’s some kind of activist when it is for her gain, and whatever she does when it comes to charity is like… hardly a fraction of what she could do to ACTUALLY make a difference with her influence and wealth (and still have lifetimes of money left over), but people fall for that too and get stuck on the “well, she did something” and like her have 0 concept of nuance so they can’t understand that saying a billionaire should give back a bit more to practice what they preach does not mean we think there wasn’t any good in money going somewhere that needed help. Like. Cool, she donated what would be maybe pocket change to a non-billionaire but working person, to someone who needed it desperately. I’m not mad money went to a good cause, I’m mad she just made over 1000 dollars last week AND got a bonus for her presentation to the office about how she cares deeply about a group, gained support off of it, profited off of people who are passionate, then after it stopped bringing more attention she gave the group a nickel for their $500 goal instead of a more significant donation that she’d still more than be able to afford while making an actual impact toward the cause.

That was wordy but you get the point right? She cherry-picks movements that she feels safe promoting, acts like she’s an expert on the thing and soooo passionate about it and tries to make herself the leader or some hero… then on some occasions, when she’s milked it, maybe tosses some coins but makes it a big deal for extra praise when she still is hoarding enough wealth to stay rich for multiple lifetimes. She could like… quite literally have so much more influence over good causes and make real change if she ACTUALLY believed in what she pretends to, but unfortunately she’s a billionaire soooo…. Makeup and sequins do not exempt a billionaire from being fake and greedy like the rest. 

So that’s my guess. People just know she’s popular, see her as “inspirational” because she has money and fame, and think her pocket change is more generous than it actually is. And they also fall for her fake activism while her meathead boyfriend bootlicks the president… the president who literally harasses his gf online. Literally. LITERALLY says Taylor isn’t hot since he said she sucks… the manchild president,, harassing young women as usual,,, and Taylor’s bf says nothing except respectful things ,,, even when he comes after his gf? You can’t make this up. Taylor is probably like “oh well can’t wait for my tax breaks :D”

so anyway

they don’t think she’s problematic bc they believe her act and fall for her silly games. oh also she’s not a poc and is cishet and just like… in general, internalized bigotry has people less likely to criticize her I guess since artists in more minorities are more heavily scrutinized by weirdos. A gay artist can say one confusing but non malicious statement and be misconstrued to hell, but then a white blonde straight girl can say something malicious and it be twisted and defended the opposite way lolll,,,",22,2025-05-20 20:39:40

This is exactly what happened after she gets embarrassed at NFL show and the Black Lively lawsuits.

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1kr96fh,Why does everyone assume Taylor Swift isn't problematic?,mtngrr4,Sea-Outcome-6053,"You don't get it?! 🤣 it's not rocket science. It's actually quite simple. TAYLOR LOVES PLAYING THE VICTIM CARD! She's obsessed with the victim narrative to attempt to maintain her image of innocence when she's the furthest thing from it. Her PR team loves painting her as America's sweetheart, but really, she's just a full-on, annoying meangirl who is fake af and who gets her ""girl gang"" to gang up on anyone she doesn't like or anyone who disagrees with her points of view or narrative and then ditches them the moment she has no use for them anymore because where's that massive girl gang she had at her disposal a few years ago at now? They seem to disappear every time she has a boyfriend and only come out to rally around poor Taylor when she has a rich people problem. Her singing is mediocre, and she can kinda play the guitar. That's why her PR team, as well as herself, focus so much on her constant victim narrative and her physical appearance. She uses people to her own benefit and then throws people away as if they're not human and disposable. She's been through boyfriends more than she has changed her knickers, but no, of course, poor Taylor wouldn't do anything that bad! She's America's sweetheart! And she owns lots of cats!🙄 

In reality, Taylor is just a mediocre talent who enjoys bullying people, lying, and getting away with it all because she's a nepo baby and not familiar with the word ""NO."" She is someone who loves pretending that she got where she is all on her own talent when in reality she got where she is because of her daddy's money and influence. Blake lively is the same. She was born into an acting family who were already famous, and she also isn't familiar with being told, ""NO."" That's been made evidently clear over the years. The facts are simple, and they're there between her PR teams lines of lies. Taylor Swift only got to where she was because of her father, and she stepped on others to help her get to the very top. She's a piece of shit person. That's the simple truth of it. Those ""Swifties"" can fight all they want, but eventually, the truth always comes out one way or another, and when it does? Watch all her precious Swifties turn against her in a heartbeat. The part I don't understand is why people look up to her so much. How is she a perfect example of getting into the music industry? How is she an influential person when she treats people like she's wiping her ass crack with toilet paper? Just use, wipe, and flush away into oblivion when they dont benefit you anymore? Do we peasants just have to have no moral compass and step on people to get what we want, too? Do we have to play the victim card like she does? Do we just destroy anyone we see as a threat because they have real talent? Do we have to be pathetic excuses of a human being, too? Do we have to pretend that we're doormats to the media all while actually being the person who steps on people like doormats? Because personally? I'd honestly rather live a peaceful, drama free life without stepping on others to get where I want to be. She's just mediocre and pathetic. No doubt her next boyfriend will be on her insta within the next year.",3,2025-05-22 13:25:23

You have to know in your mind she’s never going to meet or be with Olivia, I’m 23F and I say all the time that if Taylor Swift walked in it’s game over for my BF(who I love and will marry lmao) bc it’s never going to happen. He loves some of his artists and we joke back and forth about it. 

I think you’re a little insecure in the relationship and that’s okay! You might need extra reassurance from her and that’s okay to ask! I feel like this is deeper than her having  celebrity crush on someone. 

I think it’s good to let her know you’re uncomfortable (after exams, good call there OP), but I wouldn’t expect her to change. Think about what you want this conversation to end in.

Personally I do think “celebrity crushes” are totally different than a “real crush” but it’s still something that makes you uncomfortable. There’s not much you can do besides communicate but I do think a lot of this comes out of a place of insecurity which doesn’t invalidate the fact you’re feeling these things reality is just different for you two. She is a little extreme with how much she likes Olivia Rodrigo but Tbf I think a lot of teen girls are like this across many different genres like kpop for example. It truly means nothing and is like a hobby for most people. The comments are a little weird personally I wouldn’t say stuff like that but with the way the internet has created a disconnect for people it doesn’t mean as much as it may come across.

Cannot recommend the albums OP wrote about enough, they're all so different from each other but all still have the same Vocaloid charm that I think any pop fan would find themselves falling in love with. 

I'd also like to give a quick shout out to my favorite Vocaloid album of all time: [in my hands by r-906](https://open.spotify.com/album/1JBzD0AKtZzo5tKtMQhUN6?si=BnqXrZJBSA6ts4NqDavy0Q).

Also within the Vocaloid community a lot of the loudest Wowaka fans are also Swifties, so there is that crossover.


It's the same reason I recommended they check out inabakumori even though his work is more along the lines of dance punk - the writing style is very singer-songwritery and in the case of inabakumori, I find that his work and Swift's work kind of share this sort of ""relatability"" factor.",3,2025-05-07 13:53:30

I know how much vocaloid music meant for us, but were not here to hold onto what it did for us anymore.

Women there want out due to social and economic reasons. A lot of white ppl with Thai fetish go there and she's been in Korea for many years. It's complicated. To be fair, she's not representing all of Thai women either. Tho if I'm Thai, I would want to date outside too cuz of the double dating culture in thailand https://www.nationthailand.com/life/art-culture/40048486 

In Sweden, 80% of the Thai immigrants are women and married to a swedish man. Thing is, they also suffer from domestic violence. It's fucking complicated whether Thai women date Thai men or non-Thai men. They want out and they're taken by bad ppl overseas and can't even defend or run. They became imported wives by choice but not by will. Same for those who voluntarily became prostitutes overseas, to support their family. Thai women don't want to work or live in degrading settings but that's a cruel reality for many of them. 

I'm not Thai but like yeah, why are Thai women living like this? What are the Thai men there doing to help them not live like that? How did everything start and how to end this?

Why do you feel entitled to being represented fairly and accurately by Asian women? Is that even possible? With cultural, social, and economic differences? Did Asian men do that for Asian women? For Asian men? Why are other Asian men in the same industry not representing men? Idk. I feel like it goes both ways.

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1k4xvvy,Is it too late to stan Twice?!,moe0lur,well_shit00,"Let me put your mind at ease, my fellow TWICE fan. I'm over 45, a hetero white man living in Detroit (hey we share lakes!), who never liked or listened to K-pop before 2023. Sure, we've all HEARD of BTS & BLACKPINK. 
So coincidentally, TWICE were guests on 'the Kelly Clarkson show' in March 2023, & I was like ""OMG!"" - immediate fan. Momo was my first bias, but now it's Mina. I can't afford to see them in concert (how insane are those prices, BTW??), so I buy lots of K-pop albums, some merch, & the concert DVDs instead. In the past 2 years I've bought maybe 30 various group's albums & 9 DVDs. I ""stan"" over 12 girl groups & over 6 solo idols now.
Here's what I tell other new K-pop fans who are self-conscious about it:  it's never too late to become a fan - regardless of your age/gender/culture, & don't apologize for having good taste in music. People who knock K-pop & J-pop (like I used to) are just ignorant towards something new & different. I'm sure you've seen the unending TWICE content on YouTube? Their 'time to TWICE' episodes are a must-see! And another helpful thing is the K-pop fan forum on the Fandom app. Also, for the girl groups, at least 40-50% of fans are guys (for obvious reasons). 1 of the best things about K-pop fans is how nice & welcoming they are, too.
I can give you lots of great girl group recommendations & websites to buy merch, if you need that. DEFINITELY check out the group Girls' Generation (aka SNSD) who were the predecessors to TWICE. In K-pop, that group is like The Beatles + Spice Girls, as far as talent & influence & global fandom.",20,2025-04-22 06:12:45

I fell for her charms for the first time watching her build Lego & playing Minecraft on Twice tv. Momo later became a bias wrecker during their III World Tour. What a dancer.
The girls and their music are all very comforting and welcoming. Their sound and their concept go through different stages as they’ve grown but it feels familiar. It feels like I’ve been a fan of them since their inception though it’s only been half of that time. They remain a constant presence in the girl group category and you can always expect them to give their all even when one of them isn’t feeling their best. And most of all, Twice makes Once feel included. They might just be one of a kind, and I wish them continued success.  🤟",8,2025-04-22 05:19:27

The only difference is this was me right before the feel special comeback, i thought 4yrs into their careers i missed everything, Twice at that point achieved everything a successful kpop group could objectively achieve. At that point they were already the most successful gg in kpop alongside bp, but i was so wrong. They are still making waves and breaking records left and right. There is never a wrong time to stan Twice, they want to stay together till they’re grandmas according to Sana, so thats a lifetime of Twice 🥹",4,2025-04-22 06:04:32

And when I say older groups I mean for example 2nd gen groups that disbanded years ago like BigBang or Wonder Girls. There are so many great discographies out there, the rabbit hole goes as deep as your interest will take you. And if it's ok and even encouraged to stan 20 year old groups then of course it's not too late to stan Twice. I think it's entirely possible they'll still be together and touring 10 years from now, which means that we're only at the halfway point of their careers.",5,2025-04-22 06:58:36

I’ve been a hair band and metal fan my whole life but also American pop when I was a child. I happened upon TWICE through a insta short vid one day. The song was ‘Say Something’ and it sounded completely different from other kpop songs I had heard before. I never heard of TWICE but once I investigated and researched I was HOOKED DEEPLY. I now listen to many different kpop groups and have a playlist of over 400 songs (also a big fan of RED VELVET) but TWICE is totally my bias group. The girls are all so loving, kind and respectful to everyone and this is what I love the most about them. I firmly believe they are healing the world one ONCE at a time. OT9!

#[**Songs**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/songs)

I guess it was a good idea to hold Olivia off for a year, as she managed to still pull out the win with **bad idea right?**! You can see where everything with a 9+ placed below relative to past rates!

\-

* 155th: Aretha Franklin - Respect (9.335)
* **156th: Olivia Rodrigo - bad idea right?** / Dr. Dre (ft. Snoop Dogg) - Still D.R.E. (9.334)
* 158th: Charli XCX (ft. Christine and the Queens) - Gone (9.333)

\-

* 291st: Elton John - Rocket Man (9.169)
* **292nd: Billie Eilish - BIRDS OF A FEATHER (9.168)**
* 293rd: Fiona Apple - Paper Bag / SOPHIE - It's Okay to Cry (9.163)

\-

* 455th: Backstreet Boys - I Want It That Way / Miley Cyrus - 7 Things (9.015)
* **457th: Olivia Rodrigo - all-american bitch** / Selena Gomez & The Scene - Love You Like a Love Song / Tyler, The Creator (ft. Kali Uchis) - See You Again / Adele - Set Fire to the Rain / The Beatles - Come Together (9.014)
* 462nd: Carly Rae Jepsen - Julien / Taylor Swift - Cruel Summer (9.013)
* 464th: Lorde - The Louvre / Björk - I Miss You (9.012)
* **466th: Sabrina Carpenter - Juno** / Nelly Furtado (ft. Timbaland) - Promiscuous (9.011)
* 468th: Wham! (ft. George Michael) - Careless Whisper (9.009)

\-

**Stats**

* With 23 11's **bad idea right?** becomes one of the sub's most 11'd songs! It sits in a tie for 26th most with a few other songs: Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill, Taylor Swift - august, Carly Rae Jepsen - The Loneliest Time, and ROSALIA - SAOKO.
 * **BIRDS OF A FEATHER** nearly made the list, as 18 11's was good enough for the top 50 two months ago, but with recent additions it just misses the cutoff of 19.

#[**Artists**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/artists)

All three artists have had songs rated previously, but this is Sabrina's first time on the artist leaderboard as she now has more than the minimum 5 songs to be represented. Rankings are out of 459

\-

* 187th: Years & Years / Bastille (7.649)
* **189th: Olivia Rodrigo (7.644) [PREV 280th]**
* **190th: Billie Eilish (7.642) [PREV 205th]** / Ellie Goulding (7.642)
* 191st: Faye (7.638)

\-

* 260th: Victorious Cast (7.435)
* **261st: Sabrina Carpenter (7.431) [NEW]**
* 262nd: KAYTRANADA (7.430)

#[**Albums**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/albums)

Olivia and Billie had a close fight for the top spot, but in the end Olivia managed to just outpace Billie. Also Sabrina is here. Rankings are out of 484

\-

* 137th: Kylie Minogue - Aphrodite (7.877) / Shura - forevher (7.877)
* **138th: Olivia Rodrigo - GUTS (7.874)**
* 139th: Paramore - Brand New Eyes (7.864)

\-

* 153rd: Arca - KiCk i (7.827)
* **154th: Billie Eilish - HIT ME HARD AND SOFT (7.826)** / Tinashe - 333 (7.826)

* 301st: Maggie Rogers - Surrender (7.458)
* **302nd: Sabrina Carpenter - Short n' Sweet (7.457)** / Gwen Stefani - Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (7.457)
* 304th: Imagine Dragons - Night Visions (7.456)

**Stats**

* Despite the fairly low number of 0's actually given out this rate (well relative to an ult rate anyways), both Sabrina and Billie hit the top 10 leaderboard for having some of the sub's highest 0 spreads across their albums. Sabrina had 75% of the songs on her album pick up at least 1 0 (3rd overall) while Billie had 70% (9th overall). Olivia herself wasn't too far behind either with 64.7%, but perhaps her additional songs helped her escape the leaderboard, though she holds first place for this stat with SOUR already (90% of the songs, only Jealousy Jealousy escaped a 0) 
 * For Sabrina Good Graces, Sharpest Tool, Juno, and 15 Minutes were the only songs to escape picking up a 0. 
 * For Billie it was CHIHIRO, BIRDS OF A FEATHER, and THE DINER
 * Olivia got away with all-american bitch, bad idea right?, pretty isn't pretty, teenage dream, and obsessed
 * Despite the spread, all three artists only had a single song on each of their albums with more than 3 0's. 

Also the full 0/11 breakdown

* Sabrina - 20.9% of 11s, 16.9% of 0s
* Billie - 28.4% of 11s, 8.8% of 0s
* Olivia - 46.6% of 11s, 15.5% of 0s

#[**Rates**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard/rates)

Going to start doing the average ranking for rates now - just as a heads up that though this is our 222nd rate, these rankings are only out of 219. We've had 3 Eurovision style rates that exist in the database, but do not hold a proper average as they were scored in that point style instead of the standard rate method

* 64th: Saves The World vs. forevher vs. Immunity (7.712)
* **65th: Hit Me Hard and Soft vs. Guts vs. Short n' Sweet (7.707)**
* 66th: Gone Now vs. After Laughter vs. All We Know Of Heaven, All We Need Of Hell (7.701)

**Stats**

* With 148 fantastic participants, **Gen Z Royalty** becomes the 19th most participated rate on the sub!
* You might have guessed some movement in the overall rate 0% spread based on the album stats above, but even then this is some record. **Gen Z Royalty** becomes the rate with the 3rd highest 0 spread on the sub, with 69.77% of songs in the rate picking up at least one zero. The only rates with higher spread are our two flash rates (Sorry! Rate - 76.19%, Max Martin #1s - 76.00%) and that's partially due to each of them having song counts in the low 20's. It beats the previous highest non-flash rate by 1.77% (Winners Rate II) and the previous highest album rate by 8.07% (2017 Ultimate: Rainbow vs. Reputation vs. Witness)
 * What makes it pretty remarkable is that for rate 0% usage (% of participants to use their 0) it doesn't even land in the top half of rates (124th out of 219, 41.22%)",11,2025-04-13 22:14:47

**camerinian** (11): the moshpit anthem will always get my 11, i am a boring dude like that! But fuuuuuuck me what a rager, like even knowing the era of pop punk that Olivia worships, this sort of straightforward thrash around that actually fucks this hard seems like it should be beyond her, and yet here we are. The stalking bassline gives this song such a sense of menace, like Olivia is fully embracing her apex predator mode, and in that mode, squaring off against this girl who probably doesn’t even give a shit about her, like it is fully toxic but in the sort of way where you can see exactly the insecurity that’s driving it, and it makes her a full character that you can’t help but fall for in a really kind of scary way, like seeing something relatable in her?? You’re cooked and you should feel bad, but it ‘s the feeling bad and sitting in the negative emotions that makes this all so cathartic. Olivia made a fucking anthem for every shitty thought and feeling that you know is shitty and you know you should shut out, and it’s soooo goood. Also making a song with the word “butthurt” and it not only not being cringe, but making perfect sense? That’s 11-worthy all on its own.

**impla77** (10): this just absolutely rips. Like Olivia is a rock girl at heart, what can you say she brings it to you everytime. The lead into the chorus gets me everytime and then she just does it again and it gets me again! Guitars are amazing and miraculous and beautiful. The lyrics… yeah there’s a lot to unpack here but we thank you for sharing it with the class Olivia 🙂

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): This faux-lesbian bop! I do like this song but it’s definitely a step down compared to the top 5 imo. I think the reason I don’t gravitate towards this as much compared to the other Olivia rock songs is because it’s more serious and less catchy. But it’s still a good song!

# **WWR 2024**

**akanewasright** (11): What an insane showcase for Olivia oml… I’ve always preferred the rock songs of hers, and this is possibly the hardest she’s ever gone. I love how much she leans into her flaws when writing songs like this, because it makes for such ridiculously fun vocal performances from her. Like, as much as St. Vincent’s fingerprints are all over this, I can’t say I can hear anyone but Olivia delivering the song this well

**flava** (11): look. This ate, it devoured, it ended Mariah, it was the explosive immature pre-sapphic banger if there is one. The way Olivia just dribbles with the guitar blasting feedback is some of the most magical music sounded last year. It’s punk, it’s rock, if this was 2021 it’d receive accusations of queerbaiting and I can’t help but love it so much

**human\_performance** (11): Yes!! Yes!! Thank you Olivia Rodrigo for rocking out and honoring the spirit of Nirvana and the Pixies with your song structure

**ricki** (11): had she given this the proper single treatment early on during the era and not just relegated it to a bonus track in one of the vinyl variations, the album would have gotten a grammy

**Able-Scene6741** (10): another totally hetero bop about straight people having jealousy

**bogo** (10): with how hard olivia is going i'm a little worried she is plotting murder

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): oh wow, she made music for obsessive degenerates like me, I'm so fucking obsessed with song!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i have a full music video for this planned out in my head, yes it already has a music video but she should hire me

**curryraejepsen** (10): should've been on the main album i mean this is sooooo fkn good

**darj** (10): banger, that warped vocoder effect rules

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): such a fun song it’s been too long since I’ve listened to it.

**donewithbirds** (10): thank you olivia for resurrecting the electric guitar, we all say in unison. how the HELL did this get cut from the main album

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): dump him and date his ex, that’s the smart idea here

**Frajer** (10): ladies is it sapphic to insta stalk your current partner's ex

**hikk** (10): this is the best song ever omfg i could cry

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this should have been on the main album

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh this mothernado

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): surely you’d think about your friend and look at pictures of your crush? well that’s just nitpicking, the pop-punk push-pull dynamics are too well constructed.

**jirachi** (10): IM SO OBSESSED WITH MY EX. wait that's not the right lyric 😔

**krusso1105** (10): Nevermind, this is the gayest song a straight singer has written

**pbk** (10): everyone remembers where they were its like musical 9/11 but in a good way (note to self: learn some new metaphors maybe)

**pig-serpent** (10): If I actually get off my ass and learn how to play guitar this year I'd love to cover this song in a band.

**qazz23** (10): love this heavier pop punk side of her

**runaway3212** (10): Like I literally thought I was gonna die when I first heard this

**Stryxen** (10): probably the most interestingly produced on the album but i still just love her songwriting here so much how can you not sing along

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): fans campaigned for a reason!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): doomed yuri

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): this is how I feel about Nicole Kidman frankly

**TiltControls** (10): One of the standouts of the deluxe tracks in this rate and really would be one of the stronger songs on the album overall

**Treecoh** (10): its no mariah but it'll do

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I’m so obsessed with the bass on this song

**UselessTacooo** (10): so happy I got the vinyl with this track on it because it’s been my favourite on the record since day one

**wathombe** (10): so wickedly awesome

**welcome2thejam** (10): As someone who said Olivia needed a mainstream pop version of St. Vincent run I felt so vindicated with this one

**WesternWind** (10): did jealousy, jealousy start following you again?

**Ambrosia42** (9.7): wait this ATE i was gagged a bit

**blueberries929** (9.6): MEEEEEE

**dys-fx-al** (9.5): i am obsessed

**nonchalantthoughts** (9.2): olivia is so good with hooks

**1998tweety** (9): oh she ate that

**Awkward\_King** (9): was super excited for this songs release and the video ate and i do still love it mostly. this song just kind of feels like a bomb that explodes and then fizzles out to me like after a couple weeks with it ive infrequently come back to it. which is probably nothing objective and is just my own relationship with it. but still a hit..

**bespectacIed** (9): with your eggs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I don’t know if I’ve EVER heard the word “butthurt” in a song before this lol

**buildingigloos** (9): My gfs exes are all losers, can't relate

**Sad-Guidance9105** (9): this one is insane

**Straight-Meaning** (9): very good probably my favorite off the standard

**vayyiqra** (9): Guess we shouldn't be surprised that the woman who wrote a song called ""jealousy, jealousy"" has a lot of songs about that topic.

**kauai6** (8.9): good

**Baelyana** (8.7): should've been on the main album

**implasdad** (8.7): good psycho song

**jman457** (8.7): Its has this pulsating crazy energy that shows how she matured as an artist",7,2025-04-13 20:31:49

**camerinian** (10): we really tried, guys, trust us. As all the early ballots came in and this chopped and changed at the #1 slot, we all manifested it taking it out as the undefeated fan favourite, and then when it became clear it wasn’t winning, we at least held on to hope it could cling to the podium. Alas, it barely fell short, but what a mammoth song for the culture right?? Even ignoring the endless positions as the natural evolution of the Nonsense outro, there is so much to love about this song. The ""you make me wanna make you fall in love"" refrain is the type of perfect pop phrase that feels like it shouldn’t have taken this long to get written, and Sabrina’s flirtations scraping right up to the level of fully unhinged give such an infectious atmosphere. This would have been an epic winner, and in the end it couldn’t even podium. What’s goin on.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): oh godno the song that you are… If WILDFLOWER didn’t exist this would have been my 11 for sure, Sabrina somehow made a song about breeding so dreamy and euphoric! I love this so much and I’ve been rooting for this the entire rate - in fact this was in the lead for multiple points during the early period! Unfortunately it still dropped out, and only missed the podium by 0.4 points. But she’s still a consistent queen, never dropping out of the top 5! And she’s now Sabrina’s highest song, which I’m sure noone would have predicted before this rate. Reparations for it being blocked out of the AOTY list!

**impla77** (10): Coming in at number four its Sabrina’s highest song, and popheads has decreed this should’ve been a single. I think this song is the greatest combination of sleek, tight production, an amazing melody and some of Sabrina’s trademark innuendo that really brings a unique dimension to the track. Imagine my surprise, listening to this album on holiday with my dad so he could rate it, and when we get to this track he tanks it and simply says it’s boring! I nearly fell off my sunlounger. Anyway… we are down to Billie vs Olivia which would be what happened in 2021 ult if Olivia didn’t go out at #5 lmao

**impla77** (10): And just missing our top 10… a song with multiple 0s… get him back! i just think this is such a good time, i’m living laughing loving at all points of this one. I can see how Olivia’s delivery here could be grating but it’s full of personality and makes me smile everytime (He says hes six foot two and I’m like… dude nice try!) The bridge is so addictive and gets me hyped everytime! This is such a mood and I’m here for it

**camerinian** (8.5): stealing the nachos of… Beck? Sure why not nothing is surprising any more. This song’s funny, the hands in the air sing along for this shit is almost super corny, but it’s juuuuust endearing enough with ripping this dude a new one.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): I feel like every Olivia album has a single I don’t like, it was brutal for SOUR and now get him back! for GUTS. i think this song just doesn’t commit hard enough to anything, it’s just very middling and boring to me. the talk singing is so obnoxious here compared to bad idea right? too. i think the drag race lipsync opened my eyes to how meh this song is… definitely shouldn’t have made day 3 and I’m glad the 3 0s kept it out of the top 10!

# **Father’s daughters**

**c\_a\_l\_d5832** (11): I have never wished I could give out multiple elevens more than this rate, I genuinely couldn't pick between this and Juno and ended up picking one of the two at random!

**Frajer** (11): If Olivia called me out for lying about my height I'd kms, good thing I'm a proud short king

**pig-serpent** (11): 2023 was the real brat summer for those in the know.

**Restless\_Dill16** (11): This is my favorite song in Olivia's discography so far!

**wane them lietoc!** (11): the reason it gets the 11 is because i really love seeing O-Rod get down on doing a beastie boys ass beat for the sake of the culture. A lotta folks may not understand the grip Beastie Boys carry on SoCal alt radio in the 00s with basically like 10-12 easy to slot bangers at any and all hours. So, it makes sense that Guts happens to give a hat tip to that influence in the brattiest way on the brattiest cut here in the rate. Major highlight with my kind of singalong energy so saintly 11 dispatched for O-Rod going big in my heart here <3

**1998tweety** (10): and then? AND THEN!

**Able-Scene6741** (10): wateegbt 2023 edition right down to the annoying music video and annoying talking “raw audio” moments

**Awkward\_King** (10): extremely real back & forth between having self-respect and knowing you are above being with someone vs male attention and cock

**bespectacIed** (10): The way this has the same cadence as Whatta Man - En Vogue, Salt N Pepa always tickles me. Great song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Fuck him! / Fuck me…

**Catalyst** (10): this is Beck-coded

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (10): the only reason this isn’t getting an 11 from me is because Espresso exists

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i have gone on record multiple times saying actions like these are a bad idea……… however

**darj** (10): beastie boys

**emayzee** (10): ever since this came out i've always thought that there's a split second in the second verse that sounds exactly like gucci gucci by kreayshawn but based on a twitter search of ""kreayshawn get him back"" turning up zero results i guess im alone in this

**flava** (10): this is proof olivia rodrigo could make the hip-hop album of the decade

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if one of her songs deserves the crown, it's this one

**implasdad** (10): love the double meaning. is she getting him back (the relationship) or will she get him back (with revenge)?

**jman457** (10): Its just so fun and catchy, like audible crack

**modulum83** (10): suddenly i'm driving with the windows down in the middle of summer with all my girlies

**qazz23** (10): like the spoken-word verses with the anthemic chorus, also like the lyric contradictions in the bridge

**RandomHypnotica** (10): society needs to bring back music made to listen to on a lime green iPod nano

**seanderlust** (10): love this use of double-meaning

**sfouou** (10): i wish i could give two 11s. love the stripped back chorus at the end

**Straight-Meaning** (10): should’ve been a bigger hit!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I WANT TO GET HIM BACK

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Now why doesn’t Billie have a song called Tymps (The Sick in the Head Song)

**WesternWind** (10): me with my high school crush but instead of punching him I need to shake some sense into him (Mormon kid who went on mission trips after graduation but doesn’t seem to have a stable job and is getting married soon)

**goodbyesindisguise** (9.5): funny and cute!!!

**dys-fx-al** (9.3): fly me to france!

**Baelyana** (9.1): deserved better

**Brilliant-Primary500** (9): this is a fun song, like nice try!

**jirachi** (9): ugh she's so me. no i'm so her.

**ruhroh386** (9): overplayed the shit out of it

**skylofte2** (9): get they ass birds get they ass

**Ambrosia42** (8.9): “get him back” referring to her wanting to get revenge on him for the pain he’s caused her, but ALSO referring to a desperate desire to have him back in her life… she was kinda genius for this idk

**FluffyNobody** (8.5): as a swiftie, it's embarrassing how much better this is than imgonnagetyouback. Also, ""I wanna meet his mom, and tell her her son sucks"" is possibly my favourite line of the entire record

**arboresca** (8): reminds me of Chappell's music but in the best way. one of my favorite bridges on the album fr

**buildingigloos** (8): it's good but I feel too old to listen to it lol (and I'm only 26)

**donewithbirds** (8): the verses have the same cadence as the brad neely george washington song (complimentary)

**pbk** (8): thinking about how my ex who does not even listen to music just absolutely despises this song for some reason . i like it tho sorry <3

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): Should’ve been a smash

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): everyone loved this but it's secretly one of my least faves on the album. but there's stiff competition in an album full of 10's

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): why is this kinda og brat

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7.5): god I fucking love pop rock Olivia

**oh\_crow** (7.5): i see the appeal and its got a pretty great chorus but this song has always been bad idea right but worse to me

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7): Love the opening and her delivery on this track is great. I feel like it kind of got buried as a single with little promotion, but it's a good one.

**daftsone** (7): Well? Is it the song with the drums?

**human\_performance** (7): I bet that bridge is fun as hell to sing along to in concert

**TiltControls** (7): The verses are so good here, but the chorus is just a little too boring and straightforward for me

**blueberries929** (6.9): imgonnagetyouback outsold but still cute!

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (6.8): best on the album with fun drum track and catchy chorus and sonics

**ConnerY2323** (6.6): feels a bit like she’s stomping around in boots that are too big for her

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): I’ve never been a big fan of songs that feel cheerleadery and this has this vibe.",6,2025-04-13 19:41:46

**camerinian** (10): Boy you Olivia fans sure took your time to show up huh? In the early stages we honestly were worried that Olivia was gonna get shut out entirely by the Billie and Sabrina faves, because this was not near a podium slot and all her other tracks were lagging behind, and it seemed like it’d be 2021 Ultimate all over again. Then midway through, things started changing, Guts started representing a majority of the top 10, bad idea right squeaked into the top 3, and it looked like we’d have a real 3-way showdown for number 1. And then? Every ballot from there on only helped boost Olivia’s lead. She finally cracked number one and was unshakeable, and bad idea right is exactly the right bitch to lead her to a first decisive rate win. It’s almost the perfect sort of single for a sophomore album, in the sense that the aesthetic, attitude and charm that won everyone over on the first go is still there in spades, but by expanding to include influences from indie rock and a more ramshackle strain of power pop, she gets to present it in a new enthralling way, and it sure helps that it feels like Olivia saved every lyric she had in the “banger” notes folder just for this one song. A top 10 moments list from this song wouldn’t give you enough slots. I know we like to clown on results no matter what comes out, but after a full year of worrying this album wouldn’t even get a chance to shine, it feels so good to crown this as your winner.

**impla77** (10): I was always rooting for Olivia to win this rate and I did think this was by far and away her best chance of doing it so I am very content with this winner. Everything about this song is so deliberate to convey this sadly widely relatable story of youthful misdirections and bad decisions. The chorus is instantly catchy, the verses are fun and keep up the energy nicely and the fuzzy guitar outro is !!!!!!!!!!! I for one am happy to crown Olivia Rodrigo and bad idea right? as the winner of Gen Z Royalty!!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): Congrats to Olivia for her first rate win! While I do prefer BIRDS OF A FEATHER/Juno/Espresso as winners, I’m still happy with this winner for sure. It’s definitely a smash hit, with some of Olivia’s best lyrics, and its win is definitely deserving! The fight for #1 was close, but once bad idea right? grasped the first place, it never relented!

**jirachi** (10): I AM OLIVIA RODRIGO

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9.8): POTENTIALLY HER BEST SONG? DARE I SAY? Relentlessly catchy and fun to scream sing-along to, while also demonstrating a refreshing sense of snarky self-awareness. No romanticizing the toxicity here, but that doesn't mean she's not still gonna do it!

# **The biggest 11 I ever said**

**bogo** (11): usually in these bigger rates i like to 11 flop songs that don't stand a chance at winning so it's nice that this time my favorite song in the rate is the song that's obviously going to win

**curryraejepsen** (11): i was not an olivia fan before this song came out but this might be one of the best songs ever i'm so serious

**DaHumanTorch** (11): the best song in the rate by far, she struck gold with this

**emayzee** (11): this being her most polarizing single upon release meanwhile it's what finally made me hand her my lifetime membership stan card

**hikk** (11): if this doesn't win i will do something drastic.

**krusso1105** (11): An obvious 11 choice but a correct one

**nonchalantthoughts** (11): this scratches my brain so hard

**qazz23** (11): love this spoken word style power pop with tons of hooks; it's also post-punk/new wave adjacent sounding! also like that distorted synth bit during the bridge

**runaway3212** (11): Sometimes people just completely end it so completely and fully and we just have to sit there and applaud

**seanderlust** (11): if you don't relate to this song i'm genuinely happy for you

**sfouou** (11): what if a song was perfect

**skylofte2** (11): a masterpiece idgaf

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Unfortunately this did soundtrack a very messy on again / off again relationship for me

**stealthamo** (11): I will always be a sucker for pop punk, and this is peak pop punk IMO.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): indie rock has sent its biggest and best industry plants to try to concoct the perfect 2020’s alt rock smash that will save the music industry and yet all of them failed compared to the attempt made by a former disney child star. better luck next time the last dinner farty

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): been there girlie, have fun before your head catches up",5,2025-04-13 21:20:14

**Overall Average**: 7.874 **// Average Controversy:** 1.780

impla77: I think I gave Billie a slightly higher album average but this is the album I will keep coming back to. Olivia really hits her stride with her sophomore album. The rockier tracks scream confidence, both in her vocal delivery and in the production, which is insanely good throughout (we love you Dan Nigro). I also like most of the ballads on this record, although it has to be said there still is a whole lot of them. I will always be eager for more Olivia music and though I hope she sticks to a more rockier tone, I would also be a sucker for a more folky album because I think her lyrics are consistently top tier.

FreeCuddlesAnyone: While I’m much more of a fan of the other two divas in the rate, GUTS is still an great album and a marked improvement from SOUR! I’m sure Olivia is destined for great things in her career, and I can’t wait for what she has in store! New album this year queen?

camerinian: I liked guts on my first listens through of it, but hosting this rate absolutely opened my eyes to the truly brilliant way Olivia expanded her sound from Sour, like even the weaker tracks here feel more involved and like they’ve got more things to say and more interesting places to go, and then when those songs *do* hit?? Holy fuck the high points on this album are unfathomably high, like the idea of this album somehow being a slump because there wasn’t a several month-long #1 span of singles should be left at the door, and if nothing else I’m at least glad that the rater base recognised this project’s excellence. A real sweep of day 3 that I really did not think would be the case in what seems on its face to be a pretty evenly matched lineup, but a well-deserved one nonetheless

**Able-Scene6741** (9.618): ogs GODrigo you’ve done it again 💜

**FitzMarble** (9.471): SO good like wow there are no words

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.412): She’s just like me fr

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.294): Olivia’s flavour of vulnerability meeting attitude is distinct amongst her peers, you can tell she’s a student of the 90s alt girls. Mad respect. I wasn’t ultra gagged by SOUR, but this went into the direction of the best songs on that record, and I’m here for it!

**darj** (9.235): Olivia Rodrigo may arguably be my favorite artist who I rarely listen to. This rate made me relisten to GUTS since the weekend it dropped and my ass is LOCKED IN

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.159): hits the highest highs in the rate, but sometimes she gets too ballad-pilled, with less worthy results. lyrically she’s better on Tempe bangers, and those also bang. win-win for some of the best songs of the decade.

**lexiaredery** (9.118): I have been obsessed with this album since release. I love the production and sounds throughout this album, I love Olivia's charisma and vocals, and it's just so much fun. Feels nice to finally rate my most played album of the last couple of years

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9.088): 9.09 omg the score this album would have if not for those 3 deluxe tracks. SOUR quickly became one of my favourite albums and someone olivia DID EVEN BETTER THAN THAT. this album truly encapsulates my life in 2023, everyone i know loves this album and i'm in my late 20s lol

**wathombe** (9.088): just such an impressive sophomore album; great writing, great vocals, great hooks",5,2025-04-13 21:27:30

**camerinian** (10): pop divas doing classic new wave will always be such a goldilocks combination, like they just know the way to hit those golden, soaring hooks so, so well, and yeah it’s personally revealing and exposes you to so much ridicule (especially when u start rapping(!)) but powering through that is what makes such, SUCH good art. This album rips y’all, no wonder you scored it so highly.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.3): Another fun rock banger from Olivia! The chorus is probably the most fun in this album, and the hook is very catchy.

**impla77** (8.7): don’t really have anything to say except bop here tbh

—

# **Shameless**

**Soalai** (11): At first I wasn't sure what would get my 11 or if I'd even use it. But I kept coming back to this, the eternal banger that I've been obsessed with since the day GUTS came out. Just watch as I crucify myseeeeelllllf!

**Stryxen** (11): this is perhaps the most cathartic song of all time and she saved it as a deep cut. This is when the game changed it’s one of my fav songs ever and it never fails to cheer me up and get me up on my feet .

**beeozan** (10): wait that jangle riff with the fucked up voice filter rules and then she nailed the chorus?? omg slay

**bespectacIed** (10): Incredible delivery in here, I can't resist a song with an Attitude, like who the fuck do you think you are? *That*\ girl? You are right!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This one is just a bit sonic crack cocaine

**bogo** (10): i may be horribly single still but at least i no longer relate to this song to a disgusting degree

**Broshi** (10): ""an easy 10""

**daftsone** (10): Yeah now this is the song with the drums

**darj** (10): really fun and lively power pop, love the chorus and drum work

**emayzee** (10): this go gos serve

**fair-profile-8367** (10): my favourite since the start, and that has never once changed

**flava** (10): like she just gets it

**hikk** (10): the alternate universe where this is released as a single and smashes

**IIIHenryIII** (10): what a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): get those disney knees out ladies

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): calling this the new waviest song on the album is So American erasure, but idk it might be. Those two are the absolute pinnacle of pop/rock of the past few years, and they stand above rock/pop songs as well.

**jirachi** (10): it's embarrassing luv

**jonathanadr13** (10): the way she sings in the outro like i can hear the desperation in her voice i love it

**modulum83** (10): THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS SHIT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME MAN

**pbk** (10): ik its barely possible for any song in this rate to be underrated but this song is underrated

**qazz23** (10): really good power pop sound 🎸

**RandomHypnotica** (10): SAY IT LOUDER BITCH!!!!

**ricki** (10): i was going to expose in extreme detail various embarrassing moments from this one situationship i had that lasted 2 years (as if having a 2 year situationship isnt embarrassing enough) but by the 7th one i decided

**runaway3212** (10): This is so high energy, so fun and like just ends

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): MISSED SINGLE OPPORTUNITY!!

**TiltControls** (10): sometimes a song can just be fun and this song is that

**wathombe** (10): such a bop; i love the slightly manic vocals

**welcome2thejam** (10): 🎸

**WesternWind** (10): tell me about it, like why am I cursed to support sports teams where there are massive injury record problems and the pretty boys on the team are either injured or say/do stupid things

**Baelyana** (9.9): just two minutes of perfection

**Able-Scene6741** (9.5): this is so skate board coded we need an MV with glow sticks and punk stickers at a skate park now

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): olivia is really so good at writing about personal yet universal experiences i'm realising. love is SO embarassing she's so real. and thats also what makes it so beautiful

**goodbyesindisguise** (9.5): funny and cute again!!!

**sfouou** (9.5): big fan of the way she says comingback for more, final chorus cooks ingeneral

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.5): If you aren’t blasting this on your headphones while screaming the chorus in a public place surrounded by scared passer-bys you’re not doing it right

**UselessTacooo** (9.3): actually everything is embarrassing

**1998tweety** (9): the dance ate

**arboresca** (9): my other favorite bridge on the album, the whole song shows off Olivia's self-deprecating side really, really well. love really is embarrassing as hell

**Brilliant-Primary500** (9): It don't mean a thing and yes, love is embarrassing. No wonder why I kept feeling it in everyone I tried to hook up with and now I hate myself.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): listen its like college you’re allowed to make mistakes!

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): Sky Ferreira's Everything is Embarrasing little sister. Which is the main problem with Olivia in general, it's always too obvious where her influences come from if you know. The song is great though.

**donewithbirds** (9): pfffft i've never been embarrassing while being in love no not me (literally stole random objects from my house to give to my middle school crush like a magpie)

**dys-fx-al** (9): this is so real

**krusso1105** (9): I completely forgot how good this one was

**Ambrosia42** (8.4): she just has an attitude in these songs that is so fun

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): fun and funny

**implasdad** (8): good rocking olivia rodrigo song

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): giving another song I hear on alt 104.5 and I look this one up and realize it's by the same person and I'm like ""damn I should really add them to a spotify playlist"" and then I don't but sometimes I throw the song on in the background while I do sporcle quizzes

**oh\_crow** (8): wait this album has hooks wadda hell

**pig-serpent** (8): Wait why haven't I been bumping this one

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): Underrated gem

**skylofte2** (8): olivia rodrigo must be capable of feeling emotions that i am not

**Straight-Meaning** (8): good just not one I gravate towards

**vayyiqra** (8): This is just new wave. Welcome back Night Time My Time.",4,2025-04-13 20:09:49

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): I BROKE A GLASS I TRIPPED AND FELL I TOLD SECRETS I SHOULDNT TELL I STUMBLED OVER ALL MY WORDS I MAD IT WEIRD I MADE IT WORSE EACH TIME I STEPPED OUTSIDE ITS SOCIAL SUICIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah this is my Olivia 11 and it’s not close!

**impla77** (9.3): shes just like me fr

**camerinian** (9): one for the pantheon of “what do you mean this chorus wasn’t actually written in 2006”. I honestly have no idea how Olivia is going to age musically, in the sense that she writes so perfectly about teenage life and emotions that I literally have no idea how she could possibly sound when she hits late-20s.

—

# **You expect me to write a heading with “su*cide” and not get automodded lol ok**

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): I am spiritually homeschooled

**WesternWind** (11): have I: broke a glass (of course it had to be a previous bowl), tripped (on grass) and fell (right on my face), told secrets I shouldn’t tell? OF FUCKING COURSE

**Able-Scene6741** (10): should’ve won that Grammy but the old gatekeepers of rock love to hate on women

**Awkward\_King** (10): stream of consciousness esque lyrics are so much fun the second verse is the ultimate peak of that and so amazing. just a huge song its universally relatable and also personal its AMAZING ART!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): Can't think of a clever blurb; lala lala lala

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What a beautiful misnomer we have here

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): oh wow, I'm not homeschooled but like, this is easily the best song in the album and it makes wanna curl up and die. It feels like everything that I do will only lead to social suicide.

**buildingigloos** (10): my entire life I made it weird, I made it worse (I wasn't homeschooled, just autistic)

**daftsone** (10): Too relatable

**darj** (10): this is dariacore…not that dariacore, but dariacore, y’know?

**donewithbirds** (10): there's a tiktok of a dad scream-singing and jumping up and down to this with his young daughter at the guts tour and it healed something in me.

**flava** (10): oh you think finding out every guy you like is gay is so tragic, well how about being gay and having crushes on your str8 friends

**IIIHenryIII** (10): homeschooling sounds cool

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a real ballad of a homeschooled would include lines about how 5G causes transgenderism

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): this is sludge metal. well no of course not let’s be real for a second, this is pop that doesn’t even sound at all like sludge metal. but why, every single time it starts, do I think “oh yeah this is sludge metal”? most likely it’s the whining of the guitars in places, or the climax with strummy guitars that smash into something brutal when called, sounding like Tori Amos singing “Bodys” by CSH. the fact that it’s on the phrase “social suicide” it happens puts me in mind of bands like Couch Slut or Intercourse in their adolescence, just before everything slides down into the true horror. I really do think if you went buckwild re-mixing and re-mastering this, you can turn it into something extremely heavy, and the fact I can believe that about a Disney girl is exciting to me. Olivia carries the Chat Pilesque horror of warehouse walls covered with teenager’s man-height graffiti, but for her its not the decay, it’s the party.

**jirachi** (10): oh she's not lesbananas

**krusso1105** (10): probably most underrated on the album

**modulum83** (10): oh come on that's not fair you can't just write a power pop song and expect me to give you a 10--oops

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): social anxiety girls rise up!

**pbk** (10): BITCHHHHHHHH TURN IT THE FUCK UP FOR THE SOCIALLY ANXIOUS BITCHES

**qazz23** (10): wow this has a garage rock sound (and thankfully not a ballad)

**runaway3212** (10): Every guy I like is gay but I'm still sad (they're out of my league)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I’m in this picture and I don’t like it

**Stryxen** (10): cannot possibly overstate how amazing these lyrics, production, melodies, vocals all are. GODLIVIA

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): guitar olivia at her best!!! tell me this isn't a 10/10 song to scream in the car

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): You’re the one who has to worry about crushing on someone of the wrong sexuality??? Yeah Olivia. Sure

**UselessTacooo** (10): come on livies… let’s go… everybody better be jumpin!

**wathombe** (10): and we're back

**welcome2thejam** (10): Bitch!!!

**FakeMonaLisa28** (9.7): I wasn’t homeschooled but relatable

**Baelyana** (9.3): god she just delivers her lines so well

**1998tweety** (9): the discourse is so annoying but the song is good

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9): This song goes so hard. The second verse is one of the better uses of talk-singing in recent memory in my opinion. I just love everything about this sonically!!!

**arboresca** (9): this song's a total vibe, so i'll give it a nine, can't think of a third line, la la la la la la, la la la la la la

**beeozan** (9): this the type of song to have ""rich people problems smh"" type comments on rym comment boxes. or ""better than weezer"" type comments. both might be true. latter is definitely true

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (9): god I love pop rock. I will say I’m more laughing at then with Olivia on this one though. “Can’t think a third line” was funny though

**fair-profile-8367** (9): The most Gen-Z coded of her songs and, as a member of Gen-Z, one of her most relatable

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (9): reheated the ""in too deep"" by sum-41 nachos [booing and tomato-throwing] ok uh I wasn't even homeschooled and she still wrote this to drag me [silence] ok uh it's like a song I hear on alt 104.5 and bop to and then forget to look up but I think about it at random

**nooodisaster** (9): Me singing this on TikTok: ""IT'S SOCIAL SELF-UNALIVING!!""

**Sad-Guidance9105** (9): this would hit me like a drug if i was homeschooled

**stealthamo** (9): At first I was going to say that this isn't a homeschool thing, just being a teenager. Then the line about all the boys she likes being gay appeared which makes me think this is more an LA thing than anything.

**wane them lietoc!** (9): this is just doing weezer, really. its a great refreshing burple album cut

**Ambrosia42** (8.8): everything i do is tragic… every guy i like is gay…

**jman457** (8.6): just great tongue and cheek lyrics with great guitar.

**Frajer** (8.5): put me in the Mathletes pile

**human\_performance** (8.5): I now know why Olivia picked The Breeders to open for her in LA and NY with that bass line, and hey, that's a 90s guitar tone

**ruhroh386** (8.5): weird girls unite

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): no but the gaydar thing is kinda the ultimate plight of a homeschooled girl/theater girl like when one of my friends in high schools said I had to be straight because I loved Beyoncé

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): This was my favorite song on Guts on my first listen, though it’s since shrunk on me a little bit. I still love how Olivia draws out her enunciation of “social suicide”, as well as the blown-out nature of it all.

**emayzee** (8.4): i went to public k-12 and university yet i still stumble over my words and every guy i like is gay

**blueberries929** (8.1): Everything I do is tragic, every guy I like is straight…",4,2025-04-13 20:24:01

**camerinian** (10): Ohhhh this messy bitch, honestly I’m floored the controversy here isn’t higher, it feels like there has been a real turn again this song, and like I get it, the irrational hatred for theatre kids runs deep, but I’m team melodrama (not Melodrama) here. Without its theatrical bullshit, this song is nothing, and the way it conveys that pain is truly ridiculous, but ridiculous in the same way Jim Steinman did for Bonnie Tyler. The precise wordage doesn’t matter as much as the overwhelming feeling being conveyed, and Vampire is extremely overwhelming, which is why it rips!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): This placing in the same spot as Starfucker in ESF is so funny, oh Olivia/Slayyyter the twin flame that you are! I’ve personally screamed to this many a time, and it’s the amount of melodrama I need in my life! I’m glad this made it to day 3…

**impla77** (6.4): so lowkey I was expecting this to do worse (like late day 2 at best) but I guess that was just the TITS stan in me jumping out? This veers on the wrong side of melodrama for me, something that is very rare for Olivia to do! The vampire metaphor is so played out at this point and Olivia doesn’t add anything with lines like “You only come out at night” lol. I do like the energy brought into the bridge and the final verse but overall I just find this a bit corny.

# **Team Edward**

**Ayzrules** (11): such a gut-wrenching song about how people prey on vulnerable young women. i just adore the tense, strung-taut, shuddering build-up of this - first from the slow, almost wavering start, then to the anguish in the chorus that just aches (which crescendoes so nicely between the first and second instance, i love how the instrumentals come in to intensify the impact of the second verse + chorus), and then to the emotional and sonic climax of the song with the outro (which is such a fucking MOVE in terms of the song’s overall structure, total mic drop moment). the intensity in her delivery reminds me of florence + the machine in songs like big god and girl with one eye. And that outro - god! I think about it all the time. It builds up and intensifies so quickly, you are expecting something big, something explosive…and then it cuts off just like that. Leaves you so dissatisfied and almost rabid for more. I like how, symbolically, you could interpret this as how the story conveyed through the song does not end; there will never be a single fixed or defined place where the impact of being betrayed in the way Olivia describes cuts off. It’s something someone could easily live with forever. Man i just love this song.

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (11): I love how self reflective her songs are about her own faults her music even in song clearly aware the other person is worse. I Love a well executed and committee metaphor.

**DraculaWeekend** (11): CUZ GIRLS YOUR AGE KNOW BETTER ugh this goes so hard

**lexiaredery** (11): This song had a chokehold on me in the second half of 2023 and tbh I'm not sure if it has let go yet

**1998tweety** (10): kind of the best ballad on the album

**Able-Scene6741** (10): my inner 12 year old emo is still reeling

**Awkward\_King** (10): any hate for this is so forced idgaf!! smasha! and i understand why she said famefucker instead of starfucker because i feel like reception to this song would've been entirely obsessed with her calling herself a star if she did! but it is a little clunky. but still smasha absolutely

**bespectacIed** (10): I think this is what jumpstarted my stanning, her publicly breaking ties with her evil stepmother. This was a pop culture moment. Bloodsucker, famefucker... I know taylor was throwing up

**blueberries929** (10): this song by itself > the entirety of sour

**buildingigloos** (10): we need to return to the 2000s when rockstars got vampire allegations

**ConnerY2323** (10): very normie to think this is her best song but it just hits for me! and what an incredible vocal.

**darj** (10): BRING BACK PIANO ROCK, EXACTLY!!!!

**emayzee** (10): im only loving this more as time goes on. that buildup and bridge????

**goodbyesindisguise** (10): probably my favourite song of hers - everything about it is done so well

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a song i own the single for and don’t regret @ the we-

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): oh, you pissed off the theatre kid? the one from High School Musical? oh, BUDDY

**jirachi** (10): the filipina came out of her for a second woah...

**kauai6** (10): i feel that way too girl i feel that way too we feel that way together

**nooodisaster** (10): Fuck all you bitches, this was, is, and will be a serve!

**pbk** (10): im sorry its amazing she knows how to work a ballad idc what todd in the shadows has to say

**runaway3212** (10): when this came out oh I was dying and then I was revived and then I died again

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): diary pop meets Jim Steinman

**skylofte2** (10): driver's license two you'll always be famous

**Straight-Meaning** (10): One of the best songs of 2023, the bridge is amazing

**wathombe** (10): beautiful instrumentals, soaring vocals, and more smart lyrics, what's not to like?

**WesternWind** (10): Bella after realizing her obsessions over Edward was draining her energy

**curryraejepsen** (9.6): this took some time to grow on me but i really love this now, such a great single choice too

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9.5): I didn't love this first time I heard it, but it grew on me majorly. The bridge is so addictive (singing along to UnderstttAAAAaaaaAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAND is cathartic as heck). I do think it's a conceptually and sonically elevated ""drivers license,"" so I'm not sure if opening with it as the lead single was the best strategic move. Still loves it tho

**fair-profile-8367** (9.5): Remember when everyone was obsessed with thinking this was about Taylor Swift? What a bunch of idiots.

**FluffyNobody** (9.5): I think as a lead single was a bit of a bait and switch because guts is not that ballad-y as vampire would make you think, but it's one of her best ballads, and she keeps it dynamic (the same cannot be said for other songs in the album)

**TiltControls** (9.5): I see why people don't like it (though I don't fully get the absolute hate part for it), but once the tempo picks up this song is such a fun listen

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.5): Drawmaw mawmaw

**nonchalantthoughts** (9.3): the best bridge ever

**wane them lietoc!** (9.3): FUDDRUCKERS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): It starts off a little slow but oh bitch when that bridge kicks in…

**Brilliant-Primary500** (9): The clean version is WAY better than the unrated version. That's all I'll say right now.

**Broshi** (9): (Yoshi's note: he had a whole issue about the ""fame fucker"" line but ill keep it real i forgot what it was)

**dys-fx-al** (9): no notes. the bridge slays as always

**ignitethephoenix** (9): her vocals are so good

**jonathanadr13** (9): the bridge just eats everytime

**Sad-Guidance9105** (9): Classic with amazing production

**sfouou** (9): loses a tenth of a point for the way she says sucker

**slimboyfriend** (9): the Dear John of breakup songs about “DJs”

**team\_kockroach** (9): I know this is gonna be a zero magnet from you balladphobes, and it’s probably coming for Day 2. But this song gives me goosebumps and the build of it all really impresses me.",5,2025-04-13 19:22:00

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): Eleven 11s and it couldn’t even crack top 10… so foul. This is the first of the 2 songs referencing my favorite movies that is being rated this month, and referencing my favorite media is the way to my heart! The production here is amazing, it’s as if I’m on a journey! I was rooting for this to be top 10 but alas it’s not meant to be… Billie is down to 1 song now!

**camerinian** (8.5): god this one is so frustrating for me because on paper this sort of deep house groove should be irresistible for me, and yet while it’s really good, it doesn’t click for me all the way, and I don’t wanna *just* pin it on billie’s vocals but… I mean that kinda is it. She’s really no house diva, and the high-pitched twinge takes me out of it, which is such a shame because Finneas’ production all the way through but especially on the outro is to die for!

**impla77** (6.8): I never got this song, and I think I was rating this Billie album in an extremely good mood because I would give this a 5 at most now that I think about it. This is just too nondescript for me, I don’t really get anything from it. It sounds nice yes but I don’t really derive anything from the lyrics, melody etc which is to say I think it’s a bit of a nothingburger.

—

# **I fear I’ve seen Spirited Away twice and I didn’t get the hype**

**bluepupz** (11): I felt like I ascended the first time I heard this. But like also, some parts of the track make me feel like I'm sinking into an ocean? It's hard to explain, but I love this song! It's by far my favorite in the rate, and I had to give it my 11.

**bran** (11): I just think this is one of the best songs ever made

**ConnerY2323** (11): gorgeous and so carefully crafted. the kind of song that catches you by surprise when you realize the theme of this rate is gen z and somehow a girl made this when she was barely of drinking age??

**oh\_crow** (11): according to last fm this is my most listened to billie song by a wiiiiiide margin and truly i think this is her best song. its so somber and emotional but the beat brings momentum, and the track switches up so much over its runtime, all these gorgeous walls of sound like i dont think she can top this for me.

**UselessTacooo** (11): me in the portal to the upside-down

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Oh yes… This is still that bitch

**bespectacIed** (10): The productional magnum opus of that male eilish, IMO. Like, this is how you do it.

**bogo** (10): “yeah this song is really moody and epic and mysterious, let's give it a music video where billie runs down a plain hallway”

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): ...nice...

**buildingigloos** (10): This song is so goddamn beautiful however it does remind me of the open tha noor meme

**daftsone** (10): The synth on this track is deserving of a 10 just by itself, by far my favourite moment of a song for last year

**donewithbirds** (10): when the stranger things-ass synths hit i teleport to mars. was my favorite on the album for the longest time, only very recently and very barely overtaken.

**FakeMonaLisa28** (10): (in Dua’s voice) I’m levitating~

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): deep house? techno? it’s literally just a normal pop song with an unrelenting detroit(??????) beat. what the hell is she doing.

**jirachi** (10): ended fadjork a bit. and by a bit i meant a lot

**krusso1105** (10): possible 11 runner up

**modulum83** (10): [free_speech.jpg] i think the music videos for this era were good

**nooodisaster** (10): Idk what tf she's saying but keep saying it!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): top 3 billie songs for me!!

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I can imagine this sound being used by Janet on the Velvet Rope and that’s potentially the highest compliment I can give it

**welcome2thejam** (10): That back half is levitating

**kauai6** (9.8): budget oonts oonts music but she makes it work

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): yeah she bodied this so hard.. maybe i'll regret not 10ing this because this is maybe the only song on the album thats not soured on me at any point like its just always sounded excellent

**curryraejepsen** (9.5): i mean i was bopping

**1998tweety** (9): sorry but I always think of the danganronpa character

**asadprofessorplum** (9): Phantom of the Opera anxiety ass piano

**blueberries929** (9): Still have no idea who or what Chihiro is

**flava** (9): i should 0 it to bully the weebs but i cant make it not bop

**Frajer** (9): Billie being a weeb was not suprising

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the Brazilian funk version is a 10

**qazz23** (9): i like how this builds with each chorus, good bass sounds too

**skylofte2** (9): this atmospheric slay

**vayyiqra** (9): Here's a really hot take, Finneas is a good producer and writer and her and him work well together

**Straight-Meaning** (8.5): I like this song but it is ranked lower off the album. Good but not a top one for me.

**Baelyana** (8.3): insane production

**jman457** (8.2): Just sexy production that builds beautifully

**arboresca** (8): vocals go off wow. I've only heard the TikTok trending part and was not impressed but this song is so beautiful & interesting, it's ethereal

**dreamingpastel** (8): Vibey!

**fair-profile-8367** (8): I don't listen to this song enough. It's SO good!

**FluffyNobody** (8): I love the menacing electro vibe

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): the lyrics are a little too...simplistic? impressionistic? but the build-up to that last synth that came in at the end ate

**pbk** (8): vocals absolutely buried in the mix i didnt know billie made shoegaze....

**ricki** (8): she’s stuck with caroline polachek in the cherry bullet - love so sweet music video

**team\_kockroach** (8): I wish I could like this more. This should be the kind of strange little alt-pop that’s just up my alley, especially with that baseline.

**beeozan** (7.8): some nice synth touches but the tame impalaness of the bassline is such a turnoff and i could do without the heeeee heeee heeee's. like everything around the bassline is for the most part is amazing but it is a House song that revolves around the bassline so i can't ignore it. Billie Eilish x Dj Koze when

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.8): the bleeps are blooping tbh

**implasdad** (7.6): implas note: he originally gave it an 8.3 but then felt it was too long and so reassessed. gen z attention span lol

**akanewasright** (7.5): I should return to this way more

**wathombe** (7.5): there a large stretches of this song that are absolutely gorgeous, but it just leaves my brain when it's over

**Ambrosia42** (7): Builds up and gets interesting at parts, and then dies down again. Some of the production here is cool, but overall the song doesn’t quite go to where I want it to

**darj** (7): dare I say this could have ended at 2 and a half minutes, I’d score it higher like a 9

**Stryxen** (7): this was my fav at release but it's slowly grown more and more off me

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (6.8): Another amazing bass line. More of an atmospheric, mood-driven track, but that really works on this album.",4,2025-04-13 19:30:53

**impla77** (11): There was never really any competition for my 11 once this ditty came out, from the first seconds of the upbeat guitar to the lovestruck verses and the bombastic chorus it all comes together so perfectly and I love it sm :)) I’m happy this managed to make it into the top 10 although it is not the highest olivia bonus track! Also side note, is this the first proper love song we have got from Olivia? With quality like this I hope she stays in a happy relationship lmao.

**camerinian** (10): ok confession time, uh I skimmed the spilled tracks when they dropped and I didn’t care massively for them at the time, so I was a bit baffled when I saw how much this in particular was getting raved about, but in preparing for this rate I got it. Oh my fucking god did I get it. This sort of high-tempo joyous love song where the singer is just going hell to leather to keep up is the type that just short-circuits my brain dude, like?? This chorus is not only utterly perfect, it’s the type that baffles you why it would be relegated to a bonus track!!! You seriously didn’t have a space for this on the core album??? I’ve had this song on repeat the entire submission period and frankly I feel like a fool for ever skipping over it.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): Olivia’s first love song, and probably her most joyful song yet! I didn’t expect this to place as high as it does but it’s a whole vibe for sure.

**Awkward\_King** (10): kind of one of the best love songs ever written i love how vivid it is

**beeozan** (10): thats a rly fun bass tone

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): this is pretty great, as the title and the theme of the song circles back to the opening track and like, she finally got her very happy ending this time.

**hikk** (10): I APOLOGIZE IF IT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH JUST A LITTLE TOO SOOOOON 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): that bass tone takes me to a Glastonbury clip, with the huge sea of flags, and a snarling performance in killer thigh-highs, with stage presence that uses the microphone cord like a weapon. indie excellency.

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): HE LAUGHS AT ALL MY JOKES AND HE SAYS I’M SO AMERICAN!!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️

**implasdad** (9.2): i like the new order bassline. hooky could be playing the bass! great 80s indie sound.

**sfouou** (9.2): i can easily excuse a slant rhyme when the song bangs

**buildingigloos** (9): This is a better album closer than the actual one

**goodbyesindisguise** (9): stand out bonus track !!

**pig-serpent** (9): That guitar line sounds crazy familiar to me but the best that I can place it is part of the bassline on Vital Signs by Rush.

**Soalai** (9): I love she wrote something happy that still manages to be a pop-rock bop, it makes me optimistic for the next album

**Straight-Meaning** (9): really cute and really such a good song

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (8.9): I hope we get more love songs like this from Olivia in the future!

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7.5): [googles louie partridge] okay well. as long as she's happy :)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): shes kinda cute but i do nawt get the hype im happy for the fans though 💔

**team\_kockroach** (7): I think the drumming might be my favorite part of the song here. The chorus is a little too ridiculous though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): so american 🤝 AMERICA HAS A PROBLEM 

 songs that sound like they should be political but are just horny

# **Oh God it’s just not fair of them**

**FluffyNobody** (6.5): her voice sounds different here, but it's a nice turn for her

**oh\_crow** (5.5): i do appreciate that the guts bonus tracks are pretty cohesive with each other but they do not light my fire

**kauai6** (5): cute

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4.3): nice drum opening tune and then falls apart with tedious punk chorus

**camerinian** (10): SONG OF THE SUMMER EVERY SUMMER AND DON'T LET THE TANKER COLLECTIVE (OR THE BILLBOARD CHARTS) TELL YOU OTHERWISE

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): :soty2024: Oh Sabrina the smash hitter that you are.. This was everywhere and for good reason! It’s just pure fun, and some of these lyrics are so perfect to sing along to! While this was in contention for the early days of the rate, the 0s keep coming and made this drop all the way to 5th, failing to get a 9 average.. But it’s still song of the summer trust!

**impla77** (9.5): Espresso winning the rate? It couldn’t even win the title of highest Sabrina song! I love this song, and am really happy it blew Sabrina up as a new mainstream popstar, but I had to detract 0.5 just for how many times I have heard this … everywhere. And at the end of the day it’s a very dumb pop song, which we love and appreciate, but I can see how this didn’t have quite enough substance to push it over the line, as well as having multiple 0s (which you should read the comments to because they’re very insightful!) All in all I think this is a fair placement for an unforgettable song of the summer.

—

# **Isn’t that sweet**

**Ambrosia42** (11): i’m gonna be basic and just 11 this i’m sorry but it’s a smash

**Broshi** (11): ""It gave us Domingo""

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (11): this is just a perfect pop song!

**ignitethephoenix** (11): she actually made the song of the summer for every summer

**vayyiqra** (11): Check out Sabrina Carpenter - Espresso if you get the chance. Song of the summer.

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**akanewasright** (10): yeah I can’t stop this from winning, it’s just too good

**Awkward\_King** (10): already feel confident saying this is one of the best pop songs ever made. fully with my chest entirely. one of the most iconic songs of the year. catapulted sabrina to a-list pop star. line after line is iconic. so fucking FUNNNNN I LOVE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

**Ayzrules** (10): Sabrina didn’t you hear that we can’t switch it up like Nintendo because of trump tariffs ☹️

**bespectacIed** (10): The perfect brew of unseriousness, earnestness, luck, pop magic. Literally who saw it coming that a throwaway pre-coachella droplet would spearhead one's superstardom. You have to give it to this song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m working late…cause I’m night gardener

**bogo** (10): it turns out that after 160 plays and countless radio encounters this song is not quite as mesmerizing as it was the first 50 or so plays. nevertheless it is still the banger of a lifetime and forever the soty 2024

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): that's that me, espresso. Yasss bitch! But like, touching anybody won't make them brand new, you'll look like a fugly slut like me instead. This should've went number one but it got the Levitating treatment instead.

**Catalyst** (10): Lets pray the tariffs wont affect this one

**ConnerY2323** (10): tyra banks voice that’s that WE espresso. how do you feel about communism?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): bumpin’ that

**curryraejepsen** (10): it's just a summer classic what can i say, overplayed asf but still so good

**daftsone** (10): Yes it’s been played to death, and yes some of the lyrics are pretty bad, but it’s just got that hook

**DirtyRat583** (10): to me, this and big energy are spiritually linked sisters, and i promise its not just because theyre both 80s throwback

**donewithbirds** (10): the song is great obviously but i wanna shout out how much i love the music video. the sheer black swimsuit. the wiggle dance on the surfboard. the bending over with the beach umbrella. the skipping onto the beach in a white corset dress. the visor that casts an ""espresso"" shadow. the convertible that's also a pool. the wes anderson-ass color grading. i generally avoid both parties and the beach and yet i want to be there DESPERATELY.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I can't deny this was the song of the summer

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): changed the world. Made her music interesting. She sent those emails. Benghazi.

**FitzMarble** (10): the definition of a summer song

**FluffyNobody** (10): song of the summer for a reason

**Frajer** (10): going on vacation and not giving a fuck someone wants Dula's nachos

**hikk** (10): every line of this is a hittttttt

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if you tank this song, should you be on popheads?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): idk how you can hate this song

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (10): speaking of this instant classic. truly a song that never gets old for me. she is working late because she is a singer

**jirachi** (10): oh but you had to be there. you really had to.

**jonathanadr13** (10): masterclass in pop perfection i know that's right

**kauai6** (10): it’s such an earworm and for good reason (potential 11)

**ktajlili** (10): Out of the tracklist, ""Espresso"" is a clear standout. The balmy, smooth hit single peaked at #3, becoming a strong contender for the song of summer.

**pbk** (10): music's inventor idc ill stop eating up nudisco when they stop making it eat

**pig-serpent** (10): Too perfect? Overdone? A song that I'll continue to loop regardless? Yes to all of the above!

**RainbowSherbet47** (10): I never acknowledged the “I know I Mountain Dew it for ya” til just now. Honestly genius

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i'm working laaaate cause i'm too chronically online and living in a timezone that is outside of all of my online friendsssssss

**ricki** (10): the revindication when this snowballed her career in the mainstream and i was no longer a deranged homosexual stanning a random blonde online… i can only imagine that’s how it would have felt if zara larsson had actually blown up in 2020

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): James Hoffman’s first Pop Song Review when?

**seanderlust** (10): and i got this femboy and he won't stop calling

**Straight-Meaning** (10): this was her big moment, and you know what she deserved

**Stryxen** (10): this song… it’s genuinely unique in how generic it is… the lyrics are so funny but this boring nu-disco sound is so overdone in 2025. And yet this song and its lyrics would not work with any other production style or instruments. So, it’s perfectly done and i love the lyrics so much so i really can’t not 10 it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): rare occasion that one of an artist's best songs are also one of their biggest hits. what was 2024 without espresso???

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): and no one ever said ""Exspresso"" again, her influence on pronunciation is unmatched

**TiltControls** (10): c'mon sabrina get that nintendo money

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): On Irish radio, I once heard this song get introduced as “a song from Barry Keoghan’s missus”

**wathombe** (10): pop perfection

**welcome2thejam** (10): It's dumb bitch pop hour and you're all invited

**WesternWind** (10): that's that me, meme'd line

**Baelyana** (9.5): defining song of 2024

**bigbigbee** (9.5): grew off me EVER so slightly since last year but it's just so perfect

**NervousLemon6670** (9.2): This sounds so much better listening to it on actual headphones with good bass rather than the tinny all-mids radio it's usually played on, sorry for doubting your skills Miss Carpenter",3,2025-04-13 20:41:27

**impla77** (10): man what an opener! Maybe i should have given it a petty 9.9 because she really should’ve said tits its true

**camerinian** (9.5): the power of an opening punch to the face huh? I think it’s safe to say none of the hosts expected this one to get as high up as it did, to edge out not only so many fan favourites, but also Sabrina in her entirety??? (by .4 points sure but) This was a real dark horse that just seems to just be uncontroversially recognised as exactly the right type of tone setter for both the album and a statement about Olivia’s entire ethos, and yeah in that mold it is almost untouchable with the raucous pop-punk energy that still finds a place for the odd beautiful harmony. Unflinchingly rad as fuck.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): ehhhhhhhhh I do like this but I’m not sure if this is better-than-all-of-short-n-sweet good. maybe i’m salty that Juno missed the podium by the tiniest margins who knows! this only sneaked onto the top 3 at the tail end of the rate as more and more Sabrina tankers appeared, and I think it’d be better if this were like 9th ish… but enough off me harping on it, i still really like it! the contrast between the verses and the chorus is very well-done, and it’s definitely a great song!
—

# **Punk goes pop**

**bespectacIed** (11): Not sure of this song's popularity in here but this is my horse in this race. When she opened the album with this nuke bomb, I knew I was a goner; a new livvie was born. Like... this is IT for me. The ebb and flow, the uninhibited energy, the guttural screams in the end - the makings of a star, I tell ya. This is her signature song for me.

**bigbigbee** (11): ""I know my place, I know my place, and THIS IS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"" might be my single favorite moment on the album which is insane considering said album also contains bad idea right

**dreamingpastel** (11): Oh, instant 11.

**jman457** (11): A great intro, with the juxtaposition of girlhood with a great Joan Didion reference, really sets the mood of the album

**Sad-Guidance9105** (11): SICKENING OPENER

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): i daresay olivia's best??? incredible opener and overall introduction to the album she actually did that

**Able-Scene6741** (10): thank you olive tree for giving me the Coca Cola hair care routine

**Awkward\_King** (10): the two sides co-existing and like pushing the other out in this song is sooooooo good it's honestly a very well written and performed song like ok pulitzer. so cathartic too. I KNOW MY AGE AND I ACT LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!! man olivia's just got it

**babadork** (10): If this wasn’t in the same rate as “Please Please Please,” it would have been a lock for my 11. Teenage girls need more mainstream music with screaming in it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

**blueberries929** (10): She's an icon, she's a legend, and she is the moment now come ON now

**bogo** (10): like aaaaaaahhhh!

**buildingigloos** (10): the outro is so iconic

**CrimsonROSET** (10): #RELEASETHETITSCUT

**curryraejepsen** (10): such a good opener like omfg the breakdown too AAAAA so good i almost gave this my 11

**darj** (10): yeah I’m a millennial and would watch a ton of teen romantic comedies on Comedy Central in 1999 and enjoyed their soundtracks, what gave it away

**DirtyRat583** (10): MORE OF THIS PLEASE

**donewithbirds** (10): one time i was singing along with this in the car when i thought i was doing ok emotionally and then the second i sang ""i'm grateful all the time"" i burst violently into tears. hell of an album opener!!

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): she took down the military-industrial complex

**emayzee** (10): ""this song makes me feel like im in a coming of age movie"" I think to myself as someone who is one year away from their ten year high school reunion

**FluffyNobody** (10): I think Olivia does sarcasm like no other, and the bait and switch of verse/chorus is just executed to perfection

**goorry121** (10): ""i pay attention to things that most people ignore"" basically the description of my life

**hikk** (10): RELEASE THE TITS CUT

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ate

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Carrie Underwood found dead on a ditch

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): opened the album, iirc

**Lynflower680** (10): Alexa play “Pocketful of Sunshine” by Natasha Bedingfield

**pbk** (10): the first time i listened to this album i thought this was mid and then i relistened to it immediately after finishing the album and realized it's actually perfection

**runaway3212** (10): god this hits so much harder after just hearing that awful billie album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Boycotting American-made products does not mean tanking this song

**Straight-Meaning** (10): WHAT AN OPENER!!!

**Stryxen** (10): this scratches the exact same slightly subdued rage (in concept) but all out scream along pop rock itch that made The Steps by HAIM my song of the decade from the moment i heard it. Love so much. The soft parts elevate it and sound beyond gorgeous . everything to me

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): she's just like me since I also have perfect all-american tits

**TiltControls** (10): I don't think any album in 2023 had a more fitting and more fun opener. Really just sets the tone for the album perfectly

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): The way Olivia demolishes all her album intros… She’s so brutal to them

**UselessTacooo** (10): say it girl we all know you want to

**wane them lietoc!** (10): watching the music video on my lappy after being like ""yeah its fine"" for ages with it in car listens unlocked my third eye on this one. she gets the f-bomb outta the way and real natural to a socalhead like me. there's a charly bliss DQ-esque guitar at the end. you just need to hear it anywhere but my car with the svc high & +6 all the way.

**wathombe** (10): album starts off with that perfect, witty olivia mix of sweetness and unabashed ballsiness

**welcome2thejam** (10): Also like a Kennedy, Olivia ran over a bear with a car",5,2025-04-13 21:07:17

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): This song will be played in proms, in weddings, in vow renewals for generations. It’s so timeless… This was my fave from the first listen of HMHAS, and while it’s now Wildflower, I still have a lot of love for this song! It paints such vivid imagery, and you can just feel how much heart Billie puts into this song. It’s such a deserving smash hit! Unfortunately, it had much more detractors compared to bad idea right?, and were never able to close the gap. But still, second is nothing to sneeze at!

**camerinian** (9.5): look I promise we weren’t tanking, but as the early results rolled in all the hosts were worried that this woulda been the boring winner of this rate, which is such a shame because this song is *obviously* excellent, but it’s excellent in a way that would have excelled regardless of whatever rate it was in, whereas the rest of this top 5 feels more indicative of the entire gen z ethos to pop. Still, this song is perfectly lush, swells gorgeously, and is the sort of straightforward love song that we seem to not get so much anymore but that Billie is particularly well-equipped to deliver. A very worthy contender, and I can only assume a real favourite for that next all stars crown too.

**impla77** (8.6): This is a great track, it really is, with such a lovely melody and amazing lyrics but man I’m glad this track didn’t win lmao. A very deserving second place but couldn’t reach the heights of bad idea right? in the end

# **11s of a feather, mostly stuck together**

**1998tweety** (11): Billie does this thing where I don't really care for most of her album/era but then she releases one song that both floors me and the world; last time it was Happier Than Ever and now its Birds of a Feather. Despite coming out in May, I didn't really get into this song too much until September, which was also the month my grandmother passed away. It sounds cold but we weren't overly close and she was old, so I wasn't too shaken up when it happened, but sometimes a song finds you at a specific time and that's that. When I hear it, I think of both her and my grandfather who passed around 5 years prior, and to me that's the most powerful thing music can do.

**asadprofessorplum** (11): Her magnum opus I fear. One of the most immaculate vibes in a song ever made. Sang live at the Olympics in front of the whole world simply because it exists. Birds of a Feather you will always be famous!!

**Brilliant-Primary500** (11): I'll love you til that day that I die! This song has that rare achievement of making me tear up a lot. I want this to win because it's easily the best song off this rate and if it doesn't win or reach top10, I'll fucking try to hook up with a woman after years of not doing it.

**daftsone** (11): I get literal chills every time I listen to this song, beautiful

**DevilsOfLoudun** (11): A generational song, I can't imagine ever getting tired of hearing it.

**DirtyRat583** (11): its amazing, you add a drumkit to a ballad and suddenly its good

**donewithbirds** (11): the kind of love song that makes me ACHE. the capital-r Romantic morbidity. the contrast between the cooing, intimate vocals on the verses and the desperate, pleading belt on the bridge. the lyrics ""i knew you in another life/you had that same look in your eyes."" OH i'm so unwell about it i'll be singing this song when i'm eighty. perfection.

**jirachi** (11): guys what if i get loved by someone like this song? what if????

**kauai6** (11): mane……………………………………………………………………………… this song means a lot to me

**modulum83** (11): You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with. You know what I mean, anybody. Children were singing the song at graduations. At weddings. At funerals

**pheromenos** (11): lowkey want olivia to win but also im greedy for an 11 win (may not age well)

**RainbowSherbet47** (11): The day this song clicked in my head was euphoric I stg

**team\_kockroach** (11): Little surprised that Billie didn’t let the instrumental sit a little longer before coming in with her first verse. But fuuuuuuck this might be the best pre-chorus of 2024.

**TiltControls** (11): I love the main songs from all three artists so much that it made narrowing down to this one so difficult. In the end what really threw this one over the other two was just how easy it is to listen to. I could have it playing for almost the whole day and still not grow tired of it. Happier Than Ever is one of my favourite Billie songs since it's such a huge moment when it hits that half way mark, but Birds of a Feather almost is the opposite - perfectly consistent throughout (though whenever the drums pick up during the chorus somehow raises it another level above that).",4,2025-04-13 21:16:09

**Overall Average**: 7.826 **// Average Controversy:** 1.959

impla77: It’s kinda crazy how this was my highest average (I think, I’m not checking its 2am lol) and yet it’s the album I have the least to say about. I think this is a very solid album, a majority of the songs I really like, and it is so well put together, but I must admit, it’s kinda grown off me in the month I’ve done the rate. The production is stellar as always, but I guess I can’t connect to the songs as much as I’d like to after sitting for them for a while. I’d still give this album overall a good score and I do like listening to it as a whole especially in the background, but if I’m concentrating on the music itself instead of doing something else too I’d like to get more out of the songs. Anyway when can we hear the next one?

FreeCuddlesAnyone: It’s no secret that this is my favorite album in the rate, and I’m horrified at how bad it did! While it escaped the bottom 10, having only 1 song in the top 10 is insane and undeserving! Maybe you all need to learn to appreciate mellow music? I get the criticism of the album having too many production switches, but I’m not complaining when the music in both parts is this good. We’ll avenge you in 3 years Billie…

camerinian: as someone who admittedly has been only ever a casual fan of Billie’s, never quite going head over heels for any of her projects, it’s unfortunate that this never fully clicked for me in the way that so many others seem to have obsessed over it. That said, the moments of beauty on this thing really shine through, like Billie’s knack for intimacy is well known by this point and for me it’s a trait that works the more specific she’s being, and when she goes for broader feeling the returns are a lot more mixed, and that seems to have been how the album was taken here. Now maybe, *maybe*, that also has something to do with her not having deluxe tracks to distort the averages, but Billie almost entirely surviving to say 2 shows that those who get her style really get it, and I’m glad for them that she’s had such runaway success with this, even if she couldn’t quite close out the W here.

**daftsone** (10.100): I adore this album, my absolute favourite album of 2024, not a single miss on it

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.650): one of my fave albums. Billie Eilish is experimenting with her sounds, and I freaking LOVE IT. it’s insane hearing an industry plant turning around and knocking out an album that seems to take the opulence of mainstream-alternative 70s/80s figures like David Bowie or Kate Bush or even my guys Talking Heads and making her own “Side A is normal, Side B goes off the rails” album (hers is obviously WAY more commercial-minded than those ones, but still) and combining it with synths and guitarwork that’s MTV revamped for TikTok, with a scope in sound that's left her previous records untouched on my vinyl player. The thing I love about Billie Eilish is I feel like she’s living that life popstars used to have where they could just have a deepcut that was a 7 minute long song about getting cocaine and prostitutes for a monkey, or take a swerve into, like, industrial if she wanted. She could do it. Her future’s bright.

**Angrysalmonroll** (9.570): A gorgeous album sprawling with unique production choices. Certainly Billie's most mature project yet and even more impressive considering Billie's a pop star, yet HMHAS doesn't feel like a conventional pop album. As alluded, the productions a major highlight on this project and while this is not an album I can constantly return to due its melancholic nature, it's one I still fondly remember for its fullness and storytelling.

**Catalyst** (9.550): Her best one yet.

**buildingigloos** (9.500): Billie is normally too depressing for me to listen to a lot, but this album is very good. I look at Billie Eilish like that screenshot of Lois Griffin looking at the pill bottle, if I'm listening to her a lot I'm normally Not Doing Well.

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.350): I’m a big Prince fan, and at one point I was thinking about how disappointing it was that there were no major pop stars who seemed as committed to following their own artistic muse and pushing their music forward as he was. Then I stopped and remembered this album existed. It works so beautifully as both pop music and a full fledged piece of artistic expression that it honestly just blows me away. And to be able to go this creative and ambitious and conceptual at 23?? We’re blessed to have her. Every single one of her albums so far have been better than the last and I see absolutely no reason why that trend won’t continue

**donewithbirds** (9.300): my album of the year last year!!!! billie just keeps getting better and better it's wild. the best she's ever sounded and the best she and finneas have ever written. such a gorgeous and cohesive piece of work.

**krusso1105** (9.200): Probably my favorite album in the rate, mainly because of how consistently good it is

**Able-Scene6741** (9.150): dumb ass title is holding this back from the 10 cuz I’m not telling people my favourite album is ‘hit me hard and soft’ domestic violence is wrong #fiftyshadesisabuse

**lexiaredery** (9.050): Actually sitting down and assigning scores to these songs really made me realize how incredible this album is and what a great experience it is listening to it. It's not like I didn't like it, I just don't think I've really appreciated the beauty of it over the last year to the fullest extent that I should have.

**bluepupz** (9.000): I love this album!!! It's been on repeat for a while - definitely one of my top listens. I'm pretty sure I was listening to this when I first came across the rate announcement, and I took it as a sign to do the rate lol. The album has immaculate production that allows the songs to be cohesive and flow into each other. Chihiro is my favorite, but I want to give a special shoutout to the 1-2 punch of Bittersuite and Blue.

**DraculaWeekend** (9.000): Still mad this didn't win any Grammys

**jirachi** (9.000): My hardware is getting too hard I like software, it makes me calm and stuff I like wearing robes, playing Stereolab I like hanging out with my mom and dad I don't want to quantize everything I wanna make a computer that gives me pleasure I wanna cut you and I wanna paste me I wanna kick and scream and shout like a bee sting

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.900): Possibly my favorite Billie album! She simply remains the most consitent ""new"" pop girl for me, and with this album it's readily evident to me she's become a master of her craft. All tight, killer-no-filler, refining the things that made When We All Fall Asleep an eye-opening debut.

**Frajer** (8.900): it's been cool to see how Billie has evolved as an artist while still maintaining what makes her so unique, it's also nice to see her more comfortable in her sexuality

**nayanasha** (8.860): some instant hits, some slow burners, but overall really really good

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8.750): I like how the songs in this album felt like they have distinct halves.

**NervousLemon6670** (8.570): A good album for sure, with a tonne of pathos, but 50 minutes of mostly slow heartwrenchers is not something I see myself coming back to particularly often. Maybe it can go in the ""sad girl evening"" playlist

**Outside-Pianist-5082** (8.540): 8.5

**nooodisaster** (8.450): can relate to the title

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.450): 8.45 easily my favourite billie projects and the first one i liked immediately. she really did her shit here, i love a short solid piece of work

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8.450): Billie is so unfairly talented ughhh. This is her best album so far but I know that her magum opus yet to come. Usually albums start strong, lag in the middle and finish strong, but HIT ME HARD AND SOFT is strongest in the middle for me. That run from BIRDS OF A FEATHER to L'AMOUR DE MA VIE is just insane.

**indie\_fan\_** (8.410): ig I'm glad my original scores got lot/accidentally deleted cause this last listen >>>. It is a good thing in the end cause i was getting tired of some people acting like i absolutely despised the March rates, so here y'all fucking go.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.400): She’s good!

**wathombe** (8.300): i disliked almost all of this album when it dropped, though a lot of it grew on me over time; i particularly disliked the tracks that become entirely different songs halfway through, sometimes more than once, and those really stood out to me for some reason and turned me off to the whole project for a long time

**Standard-Ad-7249** (8.200): misunderstood by the general public, should've won a grammy or two

**vayyiqra** (8.100): Wish I gave this album more of a chance when it came out, I don't know why I didn't. I like Billie, always have, she's not one of my favourite artists but she is very consistent and the acclaim she gets is earned. This is a really well-made album from front to back. Maybe even comparable to Melodrama.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): I didn’t expect this being so high, but I’m not complaining! It’s just such a fun track, and the double entendre is so masterful. Sabrina’s pen is cooking fr…

**camerinian** (8.5): maybe it's cos I assumed the deluxe tracks had an uphill battle with so little time from release to rating, but i did not expect this to smash as high as it did! not hard to see why though, the instrumental is so bouncy and free-wheeling, the sort of energy the standard edition could have afforded more of if day one was anything to go by

**impla77** (6): how the hell did this get so high up? This is a completely fine track to me, but is kinda generic imo? Of course we all know Sabrina loves a double entendre and this one is the most obvious one to ever exist I fear. I think there’s a few great lyrics exploring this expectation of the 15 minutes of fame and putting a middle finger up at it but it’s also mixed in with the most telegraphed sex jokes you could make. Just doesn’t work for me and also leads into the Dolly Parton collab which jumpscares me everytime.

# **Out for smoko**

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**asadprofessorplum** (10): “I'll leak some pictures maybe. Say somethin' batshit crazy” oh so you’ve done a popheads rate before?

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is working its way to becoming my favourite from the album, such a fabulous meta-commentary on sabrina's career and feels like her affirming her place in the industry like im not going fucking anywhere!!

**bespectacIed** (10): A song this good should have been on the standard wth

**bogo** (10): juno was such a good song she had to make it a second time

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): the chorus never happened to me after I thought about it and now I'm just sad. It doesn't take me two minutes to finish because I probably gooned too much as a teenager and now I'm mentally ill. This is a pretty good song other than that.

**buildingigloos** (10): We love a self aware queen, I hope she has more than 15 mins of fame though. Also, all the bonus tracks add up to 15 mins?? Her mind. It was the perfect first song for bonus tracks/an EP. I'm already seated for her next project.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me making my presentations before class

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I can make minute rice 15 times

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): “let’s meet the contests!”-ass opening

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (10): but you're not going to forget about her just yet!! when did all you bitches get so nice?? an instant classic to me. all the best parts of her brand (bouncy production, witty lyrics, vocals) in 1 song

**jirachi** (10): I COULD MAKE YOU CUM 20 TIMES A NIGHT

**kauai6** (10): come on carpenters let’s go everybody better be jumpin

**NervousLemon6670** (10): If I said this had Kylie vibes, what then?

**pbk** (10): this song is kinda ugly but she makes it work it's subversive it's got that je ne sais quoi

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the way i didn't even get the euphamism for fame at first, i just thought this was fully a song about getting as many guys off as possible in 15 minutes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I feel majorly vindicated for having been a Sabrina truther since Sue Me, go get 'em girl!

**Stryxen** (10): 15 minutes of fame… 15 minute deluxe… the other obvious meaning…. She’s a visionary my god

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): BRIDGEEEEEEE ATEEEEE i think this should've got the deluxe push that Busy Woman did.

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Giorgio Moroder WISHES he made this

**wane them lietoc!** (10): now DIS is the throwback overproduced 80s jangle power slop we need

**wathombe** (10): back to the entendre goldmine

**WesternWind** (10): can she also make a 15 minute version of this track

**ricki** (9.8): lasting 2 whole minutes is actually a great accomplishment

**Baelyana** (9.7): pop perfection

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): ive never heard a bass this delicious in pop music in my entire life maybe

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): oh saqueena i think you will have longer than 15 minutes of fame looking at your ticket prices

**DaHumanTorch** (9): not including this on the standard was straitjacket behavior

**donewithbirds** (9): a blast!!! once again sabrina makes self-awareness a superpower. ""when did all you bitches get so nice?"" babe i've been wondering the same thing

**dreamingpastel** (9): Sabrina's a riot in this one. I can't help but love it.

**FluffyNobody** (9): the disco vibes are immaculate

**Frajer** (9): she's microdosing hooking up

**IIIHenryIII** (9): what a fun song, I love the guitar

**RainbowSherbet47** (9): “Only gonna take two to make you finish” These boys on this album can’t catch a fucking break. Good.

**runaway3212** (9): Honestly I'm glad I'm gay cause I just know I could not keep up with Sabrina

**skylofte2** (9): a true bop

**modulum83** (8.7): why is this kinda giving all i want for christmas is you

**ConnerY2323** (8.6): such a massive joy! seems weird to lament a sabrina song not becoming a hit but can we stream this one a little harder

**darj** (8.5): I had fun

**krusso1105** (8.5): The most I have liked a recent song by her and it's a random bonus track...

**bigbigbee** (8): Too confusing a duration of time to be a clear sex reference

**qazz23** (8): Time left for rate procrastinators:

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): Cute but short

**slimboyfriend** (8): sounds like her Cher show debut

**emayzee** (7.9): something something feather nachos

**arboresca** (7.5): I can also do a lot with 15 minutes, for example I can listen to these deluxe tracks and still have two minutes to make you finish

**dys-fx-al** (7.5): this is just fun. she can have my 15 minutes

**Soalai** (7.5): Fun bassline, I like how it builds

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7.3): Love that crunchy opening guitar line. This is the star of the deluxe edition by a mile for me. On point lyrics given her meteoric rise this past year, and a great representation of her tongue-in-cheek humor and approach to her career.

**blueberries929** (7.1): We need 15 Minutes (15 Minute Version) (Sabrina's Version) (From The Vault)

**human\_performance** (7): I have a feeling this song was written and recorded after Sabrina's big mainstream breakthrough after she found her audience and sound. Campy, fun pop song with a great keyboard riff

**nooodisaster** (7): great lyrics

**vayyiqra** (7): Inspired by Lee Hyori - 10 Minutes (I made that up)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Stop being horny girl!!! Damn

**impla77** (8.3): I’m sure this fits GREAT in this movie that I haven’t watched, but even outside of it the haunting quality is plenty enough to be compelling. These kinda are the most predictable bonus rate results of all time but I am happy that this got a decent average anyway!

**camerinian** (7.5): is this one of those things where i really should have seen the movie in order to really resonate with the track? I only ever saw the first hunger games and I felt I’d be so out of my depth if I went to the prequel not knowing presumably a bunch of major plot points. Why did katniss even agree to go do the games again like girl no u will die haha

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): eh… i don’t care for this song i fear. doing a hunger games soundtrack is a big shoes to fill with the previous smashes and I feel like this pales in comparison!

---

**Able-Scene6741** (10): 10/10 movie too

**asadprofessorplum** (10): It’s no Lorde curated playlist but it’s serve nonetheless!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): love the hunger games franchise so so dearly so excited for the new book in a couple weeks and this song is just.. perfection. like no notes its aging beautifully for me it makes me so happy. references to the story that aren't shoehorned and actually sound natural, written from lucy's perspective but can be just as easily flipped to be about snow and his reach of power and influence. chills .. chills

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Olivia should also be halfway to an EGOT tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (10): they were so scared of you

**dys-fx-al** (10): this song is perfect (and reminded me how hot tom blythe with a buzzcut is)

**FakeMonaLisa28** (10): so close to giving this an eleven

**FitzMarble** (10): I love the Hunger Games, and this song captures the vibe so well

**Frajer** (10): Lucy Gray Baird you will always be famous

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Songbirds and Snakes was pure cinema

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song transformed lucy gray baird from an 11 of a character to a 174245

**runaway3212** (10): I think is beyond stunning

**stealthamo** (10): Deserved to be Oscar-nominated. Would've lost, but we didn't need another listless Diane Warren song instead of this.

**Stryxen** (10): we got chills sis

**TiltControls** (10): really just a powerhouse of a track. Real 11 potential on this one (if it were allowed)

**UselessTacooo** (10): this smasha

**kauai6** (9.5): holy shit now this is good

**ricki** (9.5): im sorry she was literally birthed by miss swift herself

**arboresca** (9): the attention to detail in this song goes so hard, it really feels like something Lucy Gray would sing & connects to the Hunger Games franchise as a whole. also the building harmonies in the bridge give me chills every time.

**buildingigloos** (9): I don't know if this is a hot take, but Olivia is truly Taylor's daughter. This is the little sister of Safe and Sound, even down to the video (and that's not a bad thing! I love safe and sound)

**donewithbirds** (9): this should have gotten SO much more awards buzz i'll die mad about it

**FluffyNobody** (9): this folksy vibe really fits her voice, I would love for her to go all ""folklore"" on her next record

**krusso1105** (9): I still haven't seen the movie this is attached to because I don't care about President Snow, but this is better than I remember

**nooodisaster** (9): take me back to nov 2023 when everything felt okay for 2 weeks.

**Standard-Ad-7249** (9): too good to be part of a soundtrack

**modulum83** (8.7): i bet if you said this was a phoebe bridgers song and submitted it on r/indieheads it would get 5000 upvotes

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this fits so well with the movie

**oh\_crow** (8.5): clears all the slower paced songs on guts with ease

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.5): It’s pretty

**wane them lietoc!** (8.5): olivia do you need me to keep time on you? do you want me to assign robert peckinhold to butter your muffin?

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8.3): CLEAR winner of the bonus tracks, come on. The production is crisp and cinematic, it's got energy, it feels empowering effortlessly as opposed to the Barbie track which feels like it was written specifically to be empowering (which thus makes it feel less so). YOU CAN'T! YOU CAN'T! CATCH ME NOW!

**NervousLemon6670** (8.1): My best friend loves these books and films so if I give this a bad score she will kill me. It feels like a decent break-up song, but there is probably some deep lore I am missing from only having read the original trilogy of books, like, a decade ago.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): good but not my cup of tea.

**dreamingpastel** (8): Haunting!

**WesternWind** (8): slay

**jman457** (7.5): close enough, welcome back appalachian gothic Taylor swift

**Soalai** (7.5): Not the most exciting but it fits the folksy style of the Hunger Games soundtracks

**bespectacIed** (7): Lorde released Yellow Flicker Beat and promised no one would ever release a memorable Hunger Games song ever again lol. This was okay, she tried to reheat some Fleet Foxes nachos and it almost worked. Needed more oomph, more pump

**daftsone** (7): Not a bad song for a movie

**goodbyesindisguise** (7): i like it and I think it fits really well in the hunger games world

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7): trying not to let my irrational hatred of the dude from the movie cloud my judgment but his face fucking pisses me off and he's in the damn mv and he's got that damn skinhead haircut like why are people thirsting over this aryan youth member this eminem wannabe okay let me calm down. nice song.

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): I love Rachel Zegler

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s… a start. I think a better singer could have slayed this

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (6.9): finally a whisper vocal with some inflection and emotion

**indie\_fan\_** (6): idk I'm kinda :summerwalkerdebutalbum: atp

**sfouou** (6): could have done with one fewer repetiton but not bad overall

**skylofte2** (6): this is cute but no one is touching the original hunger games movies soundtrack i'm sawry.....safe and sound? MELTDOWN?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): not chappell roan’s best work

**team\_kockroach** (6): I’m frustrated that I had to sit through the first two minutes of this song before it finally starts to get good.

**vayyiqra** (6): What are Olivia's political beliefs, do we know, is she based??? Do you think Olivia would help overthrow a dictatorial government and abolish the carceral state. Idk, I like to think she would. [update just found out about the Fund 4 Good it's pretty cool]

**Ambrosia42** (5.5): it’s fine. It seems like it’s probably good for the movie, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to ever listen to this.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): a mediocre song to a good movie

**pbk** (5): i always thought this was mid sorry. this movie was amazing tho like idk not everyone's gonna get it but i did i got it. ykno actually i was gonna stop there but i wanna tangent. ballad of songbirds and snakes was so fucking good?? i had no expectations bc i didnt read the book despite loving the original trilogy but miss suzanne collins really proved why she's that bitch bc that's one of the most wild and tragic villain origin stories i've ever seen like i was GAGGED at every turn

**innuendo\_overdose** (4.8): trailerbait fanmade emvee bullshit, I wonder what Harry Potter characters have had edits to this?",3,2025-04-13 19:53:46

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): definitely a beautiful soundtrack and an obvious winner of the bonus! maybe we should have put it in the rate, billie would have 2 top 10 songs then….

**impla77** (5): zzzzzzzzzzz (sorry I’ve run out of time to explain why I don’t like this song lol)

---

**1998tweety** (10): although enjoyment...rip

**Able-Scene6741** (10): I need to watch barbie again but I don’t want 1000 streaming services so I’ll just cry alone Ig

**Ambrosia42** (10): this was so good in the movie and it’s a time where i think her voice works really well with the production and lyrics and ends up being really touching

**asadprofessorplum** (10): Greta Gerwig said I’m going to commission a song that is so suicidal

**bespectacIed** (10): Gorgina. The way I have a soft spot for this song because it was such a heart-rending moment on the movie but that ""meow meow"" tiktok sound took off and my gaping asshole of a coworker couldn't stop singing it every damn time (even up to now!!!) like a loon. It's rough out here.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh this underrated hidden gem…

**bogo** (10): the hosts are going to change this to a 10 but just know i put down an 11

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): hearing this song at the cinema while that scene from Barbie plays, my god I cried a lot and I'm not even a woman, not yet I think.

**buildingigloos** (10): oh boy, when this played during the Barbie movie I was fully crying, it still makes me cry a little bit. Wish I had a good relationship with my mum

**CrimsonROSET** (10): remember when we randomly were like ‘actually im just ken is so funny because actor man sing’

**curryraejepsen** (10): MEOW MEOW MEOW.....meowmeowmeowmeowmeow.........

**DirtyRat583** (10): fuck... she NAILED this tho

**donewithbirds** (10): idk if there's a line in a song as plainly devastating to me as ""when did it end? all the enjoyment.""

**dreamingpastel** (10): Beautiful!

**fair-profile-8367** (10): If I could give this song the 11, I would. No question

**flava** (10): yeah

**FluffyNobody** (10): this is just so hauntingly beautiful, and it's really better than all the songs on HMHAS

**Frajer** (10): Greta Gerwig stop chopping onions

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): Oh Billificent try not to hoard the Best Song at the Oscars (or w/e the award is called) challenge. Leave a bone out there for the rest of the girls

**ignitethephoenix** (10): yeah this song deserved to make her an Oscar winner (again).

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Barbie was pure cinema

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): I DO NOT CARE that I can’t give this song an 11 and it’s gonna get discounted, I just have to, and if any song deserves it, it’s this, the best song ever made!! I never cry to songs, like never. It’s just not a thing I do. it’s rare to the point of impossibility that a song combines lyrics sound production and raw emotional rawness in such a way to make me cry. What Was I Made For? by Billie Eilish for the fcking Barbie movie has made me cry three different times. It just barrels me over like Victoria Falls, and I’m powerless in its (metaphor). Every line here taps into my feelings and makes me think that Billie Eilish is just 1000% cleverer than me and with 100000% more emotional intelligence that she was able to write a song like this that takes the bittersweet beauty of youth and defracts and refracts it through the prism of a goddamn plastique doll. THIS IS MY 11, never mind the losers and haters.

**krusso1105** (10): The bonus rate 11 and it's not close

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): this song leaves me in shambles

**nooodisaster** (10): this is going to be higher rated than any other song in the bonus or actual rate, isnt it...

**pbk** (10): this was thee gag idc ik that history is not gonna be kind to the barbie movie because it will be seen as a touchstone of 4th wave feminism that views feminism as about aesthetic and choice and femininity rather than material gains but idc i thought the movie was very good and i thought this song was perfection and no one will ever take that from me

**RainbowSherbet47** (10): God tier song to go with a god tier movie 🩷

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if you haven't cried to this I will never trust you with my problems

**runaway3212** (10): I think this is beyond beautiful

**seanderlust** (10): deserved every piece of acclaim this got, including the Oscar. when are we rating the barbie movie OST?

**skylofte2** (10): a masterpiece truly a masterpiece

**stealthamo** (10): It's better than I'm Still Ken and I will die on this hill.

**Straight-Meaning** (10): This song is gorgeous and the use of it in the movie is incredible. It just feels so universal and I think thats what makes it feel special.

**Stryxen** (10): if you catch me sad AGAIN. Do NOT tell my boyfriend. That is on me.

**team\_kockroach** (10): Y’all knew if you had made this part of the main rate it would’ve swept all the 11’s, huh. The emotion of this song is so incredible that even all the ridiculous memes around it couldn’t dilute the sadness here.

**TiltControls** (10): I'm kinda glad this didn't make it in the main rate cause it'd add just another tough 11 choice to the table

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Barbie The Album rate when??

**UselessTacooo** (10): this smasha

**vayyiqra** (10): She really went all out and wrote this beautiful cut and things got existential in Barbieland.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I almost cried in the frickin Barbie movie and it’s this song’s fault

**arboresca** (9.5): I didn't really get this song for the longest time & thought it shouldn't have won all the awards it did. then I listened to it and it clicked. Billie really had us all crying over a plastic doll, and I think she did a really good job of making it fit the movie and also very relatable to a wider audience. now excuse me while i go cry.

**goodbyesindisguise** (9.5): cried my entire way through the Barbie movie. honestly this is such a poignant song and I think it will always always always hit.

**modulum83** (9.5): planned obsolesence anthem

**NervousLemon6670** (9.5): Barbenheimer was a cinematic experience I did from like 10pm to 2am after a full week at work and I fear I will never experience such concentrated kino again

**IIIHenryIII** (9): meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow

**Sad-Guidance9105** (9): Beautiful & Emotional

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.5): hard to keep the cat tiktok meme out of my head. beautiful but probably works better in the context of the movie, which I have never seen.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): i mean she’s no i’m just ken but it’ll do

**jman457** (8.4): a lovely soundtrack moment (but I was rooting for I’m just ken)

**daftsone** (8): Good, not great good, but very good

**human\_performance** (8): Good vocal performance and writing from Billie here, it doesn't fall into the trap of lyric-bombing you, and the production works to enhance the artist's message instead of calling attention to itself

**jirachi** (8): ALTHOUGH ENJOYMENT

**WesternWind** (8): cries while barbie has her existential crisis",3,2025-04-13 20:00:02

**camerinian** (10): not to invoke gr*cie in this rate where she is NOT welcome!! but truly this song and that's so true are like two sides of the same coin, except taste is excellent and that's so true is… not, and it all comes down to the attitude. Sabrina does not give the sense that she's dwelling on this guy at all, and it's because her ego is inflated to such a comical degree that she can only perceive her in ex in relation to how big an impact she clearly must have left. it's toxic as all hell, but it's for the purpose of such a fun bop that the attitude can't help but appeal

**impla77** (10): LET WOMEN BE SLIGHTLY PROBLEMATIC OR WHATEVER! This is an absolute smasha of a song that leaves quite an impression at only 2 and a half minutes. Like this is so petty but sometimes we need to stew in the negative feelings for a while. I love the guitar on this one and god its so catchy. The chorus has been in my head for months now so thank god its a good chorus! Does the concept make sense? Maybe in a metaphorical sense idk but either way I’m bopping.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.2): Definitely a petty bop, if these lyrics were sung about me I’d go into witness protection… With that said I think I’d love this way more if the production is more complex! It’s a bit of a nothingburger carried by Sabrina’s charisma imo.

—

# **Yummy!**

**darj** (11): One of my favorite songs from last year and had it on constant repeat. from the moment this single dropped I went “Sabrina gave us a Rilo Kiley song in 2024 and I am being PANDERED TO”. It is specifically like the last Rilo Kiley album Under the Blacklight, which is divisive in the fan base but I’m ready to defend 75% of that album (“Breaking Up”??? ""Silver Lining????"" Hello, the classics…) And then Sabrina somehow willed Rilo Kiley to reunite in 2025…her power….

**Ambrosia42** (10): sharing is caring

**asadprofessorplum** (10): This is the level of petty jealousy I operate on.

**Awkward\_King** (10): OH I LEAVE QUITE AN IMPRESSION

**Ayzrules** (10): oh this is just outrageous (/pos)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I love all the opening tracks in this rate, but the lyric “Now I leave quite an impression” kicking off the entire rate just feels so right.

**Broshi** (10): (Yoshi's note: it started and he said ""yeah!"")

**buildingigloos** (10): I was singing along by the 2nd listen it's so insanely catchy

**CrimsonROSET** (10): insert entire ‘why does no one make queer rumors about sabrina carpenter’ skit from snl

**DaHumanTorch** (10): oh i leave quite an impression was immediately added to the vernacular

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): unfortunately, my favourite performance of Jenna Ortega’s career (I have yet to see X)

**emayzee** (10): this opener is so good it had me cheering like the ""when you wife thinks she's the coach"" meme the first time i heard it

**FitzMarble** (10): the taste of success… because she ATE with this

**Frajer** (10): the chap stick in I Kissed A Girl after it becomes sentient

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the smasha

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Shania Carpenter

**ImADudeDuh** (10): only pop girl music video to get it’s own Kill Count, oh James A Janisse the father you are

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): i was legit laughing out loud with this album from the very first line. she’s one of the best to ever do it.

**jman457** (10): A breezy electric guitar, def my fav of her pre-release single, and just feels like a smash.

**jonathanadr13** (10): sorry Camila

**ktajlili** (10): I'm obsessed with ""Taste."" Always have been. ""I leave quite an impression. Five feet to be exact."" lives rent-free in my mind as one of the greatest albums of the year, perhaps even all time.

**modulum83** (10): jokes on you i'm into that shit >:3

**pig-serpent** (10): I love how this song makes it sound like she'd consider joining a polycule 

 Sabrina is perfect at singing words just strangly enough to create ""best 2 seconds of pop music"" clips and the way she sings ""taste me"" is peak. That alone makes this my favorite song in her discography.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): when I was around some straight friends and we were watching music mv's, we put this on and someone said it's kinda gross because it's about tasting her pussy??? and i have SO many questions on how they got to that explanation, and even moreso, why that would gross out a straight man???

**ricki** (10): she whacked shawmilla so hard that shawn had to come out as bisexual to gain back some goodwill (do the teen idols all grown up rate)

**runaway3212** (10): This absolute fucking bop like the ender amongst enders oh godrina I never doubted your slay

**seanderlust** (10): https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fb0pn3kb81r9c1.jpeg

**Straight-Meaning** (10): an opener and gives a good rep for the album

**Stryxen** (10): these new girls all doing new wave omfg they have the recipe we’re in good hands

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i just know sabrina cries herself to sleep every night knowing that she’s not bisexual

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): she saw the chance to make her own Deja Vu but she needed the other girl to feel it so deeply

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): This music video is the best thing she’s ever done

**wathombe** (10): so clever and catchy

**1998tweety** (9.5): we love bisexual women and their boyfriends

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (9.1): stellar music video

**daftsone** (9): Delicious

**donewithbirds** (9): when the pendulum of public opinion inevitably swings against sabrina carpenter again people are gonna point to this song as a ""red flag"" as evidence she's ""not a girl's girl"" and i'm here from the past to bravely proclaim that this bangs

**dreamingpastel** (9): Sabrina stop being the third in a love triangle challenge FAILED

**FluffyNobody** (9): short queens unite (I'm 5'2)

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (9): ""oh I leave quite an impression/5 feet to be exact"" kind of the opening line of all time. and speaking of lines of all time I gasped the first time I heard ""oh I know I've been known to share.""

**Soalai** (9): My fave on the album.

**UselessTacooo** (9): delusional clingy person anthem (it’s about me)

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): ooo…. sabrinita carpenterita

**welcome2thejam** (9): Do you think Taste girl & Obsessed girl are doing their homoerotic thing about the same guy

**NervousLemon6670** (8.9): It's 2025, even the songs about a man cheating on a woman with another woman are lesbian-tinged now

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8.7): A banging opening track (no pun intended). I love the sort of sunny Californian rock sound. It's totally different for her discography too, so that elevates it as well.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): This song didn’t fully click for me until I saw an edit use it for a relationship I’m more invested in than any trio that involves shawnmila

**implasdad** (8.5): good solid song that i’ve heard a million times

**blueberries929** (8.4): She did all that promo about being 4'11 (plus literally releasing Espresso on 4/11) just to call herself five feet to be exact 😭",3,2025-04-13 20:18:35

impla77: This is my first foray into Sabrina Carpenter’s oeuvre (which is why we should all vote diary pop so I am forced to listen to emails i can’t send) and I enjoyed my time with the album! I have to say, I’m not particularly attracted to Sabrina’s full on persona, which left me wanting with some of the lyrical content, and some songs I didn’t vibe with at all, or found they were a mixed bag. Still the album kept my attention throughout and I can find things to love even in the songs I find weaker. Sabrina is so charming and I’m excited to see what she’ll do next after her big breakout!

FreeCuddlesAnyone: I’ve been a fan of Sabrina for years, like I was on the trenches for the Singular Acts! She’s definitely deserving of the massive blow up that she has gotten, and I hope her future endeavours is similarly successful! Short ‘n Sweet might have been initially disappointing for me, as I was anticipating a poppier record, but a lot of tracks have grown on me! It definitely is a bit filler-ish, but she can only go up from here!\

camerinian: I really loved how Sabrina seemed to completely maximise her personality on this record, like she saw exactly what resonated with people on Nonsense and Feather and decided that’s what she needed to double, triple down on, and yeah that makes this album uneven as hell as despite somehow being six (!) albums in, she’s still clearly finding her feet and finding the artist she wants to be, but my god she hit on some potent shit here and I’m almost certain there’s a great full album experience inside her, waiting to be unleashed on the world now that she’s at the peak of her power

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.500): the trick to understanding the album is the cover. Americana sun-kissed saturated the fuck up coy JOY throughout. I’ve been known to dip into Californian romanticism, and this album is one big pop roadtrip throughout one very intelligent look through that. an album that should sit with the classics on the shelf of my opinions.

**Angrysalmonroll** (9.475): A near perfect pop album. The lyrics are cute, cheeky, and infused with Sabrina's personality. Giving the album a point of view that's unique to Sabrina. Sonically Sabrina's, paying homage to bubblegum pop while also combining her love for other genres. Which creates a body of work that's reminiscent but also fresh and new.

**wathombe** (9.406): this whole album is just so fucking good; the writing is great, and her delivery is sublime; i did not expect sabrina to drop one of my top five albums of the year, but here we are

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.406): We’ve seen basically every single popstar brand by this point: we’ve had angsty and thoughtful, we’ve had artsy and chaotic, we’ve had wayyyy too much ““bad girl””. What it took for Sabrina to break through was literally just go down the one avenue no one seems to have tried before: she became the funny one. Lord is she funny. This album is overflowing with personality and one liners and such an acute understanding of what it is she brings as a popstar (huge shoutout to her Grammys performance, which beats stiff competition to be my favourite of the year). I very much ignored her up until Espresso’s release, but once this album dropped I really had to sit up and take notice. No one else is doing it like her and I don’t think anyone else even could do it at her level. She’s maybe my new fav, I literally can’t wait to see what she does next

**nayanasha** (9.294): not a single skip on the album

**NervousLemon6670** (9.063): Before this rate, I wasnt a huge Carpenter-ette (Sabrina-ite?) because all I knew was Espresso on loop from the pop radio, so to go into this and find a lot of really fun songs that stuck with me was a nice surprise! Theres an infectious energy almost everything here, and while not all the innuendo land, enough of them hit bullseye to never quite overstay the joke.

**Frajer** (9.031): now this is how you do an album era she's mothering cause she's a singer

**OliviaGodrigo** (9.000): Love her!

**IIIHenryIII** (8.969): long & spicy

**FluffyNobody** (8.794): 9 This was my AOTY writeup last year so it's no surprise I scored it so high. It's just such a good project, and it showcases all of Sabrina's strengths as a songwriter while being fun throughout

**RandomHypnotica** (8.775): me and u/cremeebrulee

**emayzee** (8.763): as soon as i heard the opening track this immediately became one of my favorite albums of 2024. as someone who has been a (casual) fan since thumbs nearly a decade ago, it was such a pleasant surprise to see her finally make it to the pop A-list after seeing that girl HUSTLING for years. her cheekiness and witty lyricism is something that i'm so glad to see in pop. you can just tell how much fun she was having in the studio writing these songs. it's infectious. from the anthemic pop rock of taste, to the country-tinged slim pickins and please please please, and the r&b dance beats of good graces, the genres shift from track to track with ease. probably unpopular opinion though: espresso is the only song on here that doesn't feel cohesive with the rest. i'm not sure the timeline of making this album, but it feels like that song was supposed to be something fun for the summertime and then retroactively became the lead single because of how well it ended up charting. whatever they did though, it worked. this album successfully converted me from a casual fan who'd check out a single release here and there to a true fan who thinks she's one of the most exciting voices in pop right now and can't wait to see what's next.

**Catalyst** (8.731): If you listen to just her singles, you would think you'd expect a very sugary dance-pop record, but you'd be very surprised. A very well-put record that perfectly showcases her tried and true acoustic styling while stepping into newer territories without losing her identity. Adding to this, her punchy, evocative writing remains her strongest asset here and she lets it loose here. A hazy summery masterpiece.

**Ayzrules** (8.694): i love how the host described her song-writing - “brilliant/bullshit tightrope” is just perfect hahaha. There were so many moments where the lyrics made me cackle, but probably the funniest and most entertaining tidbit was where she’s crooning “i’m so fucking horny” in juno lmfao. I enjoyed this album a lot after it had a chance to grow on me, so catchy and infectious!

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.688): I could write a dissertation on why this album is more than just a collection of unserious horny bops, but I will keep it short (n sweet). imo it's an album that encompasses Sabrina's personality, from confident to self-deprecating to horny to contemplative. people have these preconceived notions of her, and sometimes she plays into it, but it's always got a bite. she's not ashamed of being silly, but the final songs of both the standard and deluxe show the vulnerability underneath all of the bravado. it's so Sabrina and I love it so much.

**camerinian** (10): the disrespect directed at this by even the positive comments was too much to handle. The claims of “generic” over one of Finneas’ more nutty production jobs? With the surfy slide guitar and the two-stepping groove, not to mention the *filth* of the outro groove? You lot have been spoiled by too many pop lesbians I swear.

**impla77** (9.5): Scraping into day 3 is the lead single off Hit Me Hard And Soft, LUNCH! I personally think this is a tad underrated within the general pop sphere, it’s just a bop, a good time, and most importantly about an extremely compelling topic (eating pussy). Everyone thank Chappell Roan for inventing lesbians.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.7): A very good song about her roommate! This and Bed Chem swapped places for the back half of the rate, and in the end the wlws came out on top over the straight! It’s fun and I really have no complaint tbh.

—

# **I’m hungee**

**beeozan** (11): why did the collective consciousness suddenly decide this wasnt enough of a bop cuz like its still a ton of fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was a decent-sized hit as is, but RIP to the run it would have had if it had been released as a proper lead single.

**daftsone** (10): Not just lunch though, the whole damn 3 course meal

**flava** (10): Isaiah at the end of Preacher's Daughter be like:

**Frajer** (10): Charli likes boys but she knows I'd eat it for lunch

**ImADudeDuh** (10): it still sends me how much they prepared for this to be a huge smash with promotion only for Birds of a Feather to be the much better song and become Billie’s new career defining song

**jman457** (10): Between this and Oxytocin we need more club Billie. =

**jonathanadr13** (10): the breaths in the outro?? are you kidding me

**pbk** (10): this song kinda got passed over after birds of a feather and chihiro blew up but i never left here

**qazz23** (10): a bit silly but i really like the beats/production on this; especially the heavier bass sound near the end

**seanderlust** (10): ""you need a seat i'll volunteer"" aw what a helpful way to support your gal pal. :)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): boy you better make her raspberry swirl

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): you thought I was feelin u?

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't think this song is about food

**WesternWind** (10): that’s a hearty lunch, but when did you become a cannibal Billie?

**Able-Scene6741** (9.5): 😋

**UselessTacooo** (9.3): simp final boss

**blueberries929** (9.2): Better than Birds Of A Feather, fight me

**FluffyNobody** (9): This is a bop and a half

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (9): damn okay I didn't know miss eyelash got down like that. and the queerbaiting accusations would be insufferable but sabrina could slide on this perfectly ngl

**runaway3212** (9): I infact don't know how to bend, my back is like two twigs glued together and both are ready to break

**static\_int\_husp** (9): honestly I think this sounds like an old bond theme

**Straight-Meaning** (9): It’s very catchy and I get why it was looked at for a lead. Not my favorite on the album but non the less a great song.

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): I hated this song so much when it was being autoplayed after everything last year. In fact, it led to me disabling autoplay and my life is so much better now. Everybody say thank you LUNCH

**modulum83** (8.8): score given because she ate in two different ways

**darj** (8.5): if we’re gonna leave our thirty year long 80s revivalism and slowly claw our way to 90s revivalism with coffeeshop jangle pop, psyop genre of zoomergaze, and slacker alt rock or MJ Slackerman, it should evoke this. some ppl pulling from the most boring parts of the 90s. Why was that latest MGMT album no one cared about giving Soul Asylum?? With 90s revival, give us more sapphic dirtbag Suzanne Vega or whatever

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.5): this is kind of cali rock coded

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): Lyrics are ridiculous but the instrumental flourishes all over this song are fantastic. The wonky little outro is great too.

**wane them lietoc!** (8.2): could totally have seen this instrumental on alt radio in 2007/8. really until the final chorus, although that's where I celebrate billie cooking hard

**IIIHenryIII** (8): stop objectifying women /s

**oh\_crow** (8): every billie album is destined to have a pale imitation of bad guy (therefore i am from her last album for example), but like it does very much hit every time

**welcome2thejam** (8): Was an instant channel switch when it got played on alt rock radio for some reason, but good in a vacuum

**1998tweety** (7.5): i also cant relate

**arboresca** (7.5): oooh the transition. of the two songs about eating a girl out that i'm rating this month this one's definitely better

**human\_performance** (7.5): I like the groove from the bassline, and the emotion from Billie comes through very authentically

**Soalai** (7.3): It's a bop but I wish it sounded a bit more joyous overall

# **Breakfast supremacists**

**pig-serpent** (7): The melody and the groove are obviously good, but at the same time the song feels like a letdown. It trades the post-industrial leanings of her previous edgy songs and leans into a slight disco influence, but the end result feels, pardon the pun, undercooked. The instrumental does a good job supporting the vocals but I can't shake the feeling that this could've been an all time great pop instrumental instead of merely a good one.

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): Kinda cringe but good beat

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it was a fun moment but didn't have much longevity for me

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): this being right after SKINNY is top tier sequencing

**fair-profile-8367** (6.5): I understand why this was a single, but it's not lead single material

**Stryxen** (6.5): gets so close to amazing but not quite in any aspect. And i will be blaming finneas as always

**ConnerY2323** (6.2): great vibes but a bit too obvious compared to the rest of the album

**bigbigbee** (6): I can't say it's bad but it felt generic (derogatory) to me when it came out which did not make me all that excited to listen to the full album

**nooodisaster** (6): It never hit, like it feels too normal or generic in this album, idk.

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (4.7): Eh. I'm kind of surprised this was the lead single, because it does no justice to how rich and layered the whole album is. It's one of the two throwback Billie tracks here that just sound like rehashes of her older sounds. Really catchy bass line.

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.1): impressively no whispering but saddled with standard pop production fare

**kauai6** (3): annoying vocals on parts of this song

**modulum83** (7): can these girls just be normal about their partners' exes omg

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): She’s done better rock songs

# **ehehehehehe, butthurt**

**oh\_crow** (6.5): i feel like this song is produced so weird like they recorded it inside a tin can which does a huge disservice to how many catchy hooks it has. i do love the genre of olivia rodrigo song where she's unhinged tho

**skylofte2** (6): obsessed with how this song is mid

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (5): Eh, I was more partial to ""lacy"" for this take. It's fine.

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.9): like other punk ones here this one misses anything sonically worth a revisit

**Able-Scene6741** (10): after safeword I think Halsey should match brina’s freak on the remix! (also Juna by Clairo is better 🤫 )

**Ayzrules** (10): that guitar + beat are soooo good. gotta love how this is such a beautiful song in terms of the instrumentals and her quasi-ethereal vocal delivery, and then she just goes and says ""i'm so fucking horny"" LMAO

**babadork** (10): I might be overrating this, but I’m really impressed it’s not the automatic 0

**Baelyana** (10): no notes

**bespectacIed** (10): Give it its tens for the long-enduring discourse, you know you that song when you cause all this conversation! For what it's worth, the feminists everyone ridicule made points, some sabrina defenders did too, multiple things can be true!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When a piss kink song wins the biggest rate of the year.

**bogo** (10): the freaky position in question being top 3

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): a song about getting creampied until you get pregnant repeatedly shouldn't sound this very joyful and fun, but it did and not only is it not annoying, it also manages to be playful and catchy at the same time. This is a single-worthy song.

**buildingigloos** (10): Have you ever tried this one? (lies down and goes to sleep)

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Well I have to say, being able to teleport is pret-ty impressive. I can’t do any fancy magic stuff like that at all.

**darj** (10): this feels extremely like a song in a musical from 2006 and Kerry Butler would sing it. A folkier more ""modern"" sounding musical; you just know Kerrigan and Lowdermilk or Pasek and Paul woulda eaten this the fuck up and it’d be a 54 Below staple

**donewithbirds** (10): SO CLOSE to getting my 11 this song is EUPHORIC. god bless sabrina for making a breeding kink, like, adorable??? somehow??? i am just rarely as happy as i am when i'm listening to this song; it's a pure rush of endorphins. pop perfection.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): okay, make sure that you two fall in love and get to know each other first instead of using a baby as a way to get to know each other because I have seen far too many people do the latter!

**dreamingpastel** (10): The sheer audacity of, well, everything kinda makes me like this song a lot.

**dys-fx-al** (10): this was a perfect song for me from the first listen

**fair-profile-8367** (10): The guitar is so addicting!

**FakeMonaLisa28** (10): god that guitar line is so sexy it makes me Juno

**flava** (10): I think it’s just the fact that this is so straight-forward and earnest and yearning is the thing that actually makes this work. It’s horny, cute, a little insecure but not being held back by it is a way better fit for Sabrina than anything else tried on this album. And also having more developed melodies helps as well

**Frajer** (10): every other man makes her Jennifer's Body

**hikk** (10): I'M SO FUCKING HORNY!!!

**NervousLemon6670** (10): The little riff that plays into ""Have you ever tried this one?"" has been permanent background noise in my brain for the last two weeks

**nooodisaster** (10): Pure queer joy (i know this is str8, let me pretend)

**pbk** (10): oh BITCH music was never the same woah...

**ricki** (10): some people on twitter talk about this song the same way millennials talk about how they were traumatized by It (1990) when they were 8

**runaway3212** (10): This song is literally the best thing ever like she ended nuclearly, I still radiate and glow from hearing this song

**Stryxen** (10): the fact this is extremely romantic to me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): BRING BACK GUITAR SOLOS!!! deserved a bigger single push, it's so fun and horny

**TiltControls** (10): Absolutely wild lyrics (in really the best way possible) coupled with some of the best production of last year makes this an easy album standout

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I didn’t really get this song for a long time, but then Todd In The Shadows mentioned the Fleetwood Mac similarities and holy shit that man has never been more right

**wane them lietoc!** (10): we got two albums this rate talking about dads : one's about profession, the other about genetics make him a desirable target for the most mouth dripping horny anyone here gets; like she's doing (dare we clock it) a breeding fantasy here. insane shit here Sabrina, please do an interview with playboy take BACK the unearned swag Phoebe Bridgers got

**wathombe** (10): i'm so fuckin' corny

**WesternWind** (10): have you ever tried this one? (winning a rate)

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): a near perfect song to me i just have a visceral negative reaction to the line ""whole package babe i like the way you fit - god bless your dads genetics"" because why are you mentioning my dads cock when we're having sex and HOW do you know its not from my mums side.... but generally a funny and delightful song and juno is one of my all time fav films so!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Millennial breeding anthem

**Ambrosia42** (9.3): I like how she has to tell us she’s horny as if we didn’t notice

**emayzee** (9.3): being 25 and calling herself juno if she potentially became pregnant is so ""i'm only 27, what am i, a child bride?""

**UselessTacooo** (9.2): this is who Bed Chem wishes she was

**blueberries929** (9): ""Have you ever tried... this one? ;)"" No Sabrina I Am A Virgin

**ktajlili** (9): The concept of this song is so cute, silly, and horny at the same time, encapsulating Sabrina Carpenter's brilliance.

**pig-serpent** (9): Breeding kinks are only hot if the receiver is infertile. That doesn't affect my opinion of the song I'm just always happy to say something horny on a rate comment.

**slimboyfriend** (9): pro-teenage pregnancy bop

**Soalai** (9): I mean, it's an incredibly fun song (arguably the strongest on the album) but the movie reference means it's gonna age poorly if it isn't already

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I didn’t need to know that Sabrina is into watersports

**jman457** (8.7): Great song and Iconic movie, even if I fail to see the connection

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8.5): Absolutely LOVE the guitar solo, and she uses it perfectly on tour as a big, joyful arena dance break. It deserves to be gleefully jumped around to and the production here is just lovely. Only downside for me is by this point, I'm tiring of the sexual shtick, so some of the lyrics make me go like... all right then. Lol. ""Ovulation pop"" is not a bad descriptor of this one.

**sfouou** (8.5): this one grew on me

**kauai6** (8.3): i feel scandalized reading the lyrics of this song

**daftsone** (8): The beat on this is right up my alley

**DaHumanTorch** (8): I'M SO FUCKING HORNY 🗣️ 🗣️ 🗣️

**human\_performance** (8): Good hybrid of the musical ideas expressed in Espresso, and the singer-songwriter ideas expressed elsewhere on the album. That bridge is kinda camp, and I like a good guitar solo in top-40

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): the recording academy heard the ""ooh's"" in the background of the 2nd pre-chorus and decided right then and there that it was the best pop vocal album of the year

**oh\_crow** (7): its really nice. i think this album is like so competent. and sabrina is very good at what she does and i like her. none of this is really more than that but it doesn't have to be.

**qazz23** (7): catchy enough, good percussion and even a solo

**skylofte2** (7): ""i'm so fucking horny"" doesn't feel like it should be a line in this song but here we are

**vayyiqra** (7): can Sabrina talk about sex is that allowed has she ever done that before

**arboresca** (6.9): have you ever tried...this one?

**ConnerY2323** (6.3): great chorus but the rest of the song gets in the way

**vayyiqra** (5): Good instrumental but eh, it's a revenge song. I don't care for those, they do nothing for me. Yeah I don't like that uppercut line either, for reasons I don't want to get into. Great chorus melody but I'm so mixed on this one.

**NervousLemon6670** (4): The chorus on this one is tanking it, it just feels exactly as simplistic as I was worried the album would be going in

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): rock’n’roll baby, but this time with indecisiveness. you think the Stones are asking whether or not it’s a bad idea? no, those lads just went out and pursued shit. It’s the Boomer mentality!! Olivia Rodrigo plays a necessary role as a contingent of those with chronic doubts (Gen Z).

**jman457** (10): just a knock out of a song, like she was like “bitch im back”

**oh\_crow** (10): my favourite olivia rodrigo by a fucking mile. i'm a little tepid on her output other than the odd song, but this was such an instant hit for me i love every moment of this. deserved my 11 honestly

**pbk** (10): this is probably gonna win and it will be completely deserved

**pig-serpent** (10): Since you wrote a hit song and made a ton of money off it, I don't think it was a bad idea.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is gonna be such a slay AS9 winner

**ricki** (10): i want sabrina to win real bad, mostly because she gags and slays, but also because i was this 🤏 close to 11ing this and im going to be real mad if i passed on the easiest 11 win in years

**slimboyfriend** (10): happy to see she’s having the normal college aged girl experience

**Stryxen** (10): she excites me so much as an artist. This 90s /00s landfill pop rock influence is not the most interesting thing ever but I can tell this is exactly what she wanted to do for an exact reason and it came out exactly how she planned. That confidence and vision is so exciting! it almost makes me want to pretend i like lacy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): an immediate highlight and one of my fave olivia songs

**TiltControls** (10): so so close to taking the 11. I think what does it a bit for me is the song excels with Olivia's vocals and lyrics and so it kinda peters out in the outro

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I remember so vividly the night this song dropped. I was in Scotland and queening out about how good this song was with my friends over text. Good times

**vayyiqra** (10): good song right?

**kauai6** (9): i want to hate it but it’s a bop

**nooodisaster** (9): Probably the most defining song of this era. Showed us what GUTS really was, and what Olivia's brand would become.

**Straight-Meaning** (9): A Very good single, weird but very catchy

**DirtyRat583** (6.5): this atrocious chorus. ruins the whole song WHYYY is it one note

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (6.5): the guitar solo kind of carries...maybe I'm just holding the fact that this is on heavy rotation at my workplace and always seems to play in moments of high stress like the other day when there was a long line and the woman at the next register kept arguing about her refund and I was so hungry but my break wasn't for another hour and I just can't with the chanting and the aggressively escalating background noise in the pre-chorus

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1jydu00,Gen Z Royalty Day 3: Don't Wanna Say Goodbyyyyyyyyyeee To My 11 When It Diiiiiiiiiiiiiies,mmymuc7,camerinian,"**modulum83** (8.947): As someone who was unimpressed by SOUR back in 2021, this album feels so made to shut me up and prove me wrong it's almost comical. Every bit of this takes the dual ballad-pop punk sound of the debut and turns it into something deeply aligned with my music taste - 90s/00s alt rock like Third Eye Blind and Beck, Weezer/The Cars-esque power pop, and the modern DIY emo scene. It's honestly a deeply nostalgic, GenX music critic baiting record that I nevertheless fell hard for, every song racking up hit after hit of fully fleshed out pop rock bangers that lean into their messy, ridiculous over-the-top drama in a way that doesn't feel theatrical but just fun. I'm the maniac protagonist of my own movie, coming of age in the most unforgettable summer I'll ever have every time this album plays. Congratulations on making the best Festival Pop Rock album of the decade, Olivia.

**Angrysalmonroll** (8.906): Olivia's artistry really improved with Guts. It might not be as commercially successful as Sour but it does mark an artistic evolution for Rodrigo. She experiments with even more pop punk which is a sound that works perfectly for her. There still are a few straightforward ballads which I consider to be the weaker tracks but luckily they are far and few in between. Aside from those few songs, the albums more upbeat and humorous compared to Sour. Olivia learned how to write about heartbreak but with a sense of humor and earnestness that benefits the album greatly.

**emayzee** (8.794): did not love sour as much as everyone else seemed to but she absolutely sold me from the moment bad idea right? was released. this is one of my favorite albums of the 2020s so far, and imo she really came into her own as an artist here. pretty much immediately after her debut you'd hear labels trying to make their own pop/rock imitators trying to replicate her success, but you can tell how authentic that sound is for her. it couldn't be more up my alley. several songs are still in my regular rotation a year and a half later, with making the bed and teenage dream being the only real misses for me from the standard edition. part of why I wasn't big on sour is because I felt it relied too heavily on her ballads, which can be a mixed bag for me, but I think logical, the grudge, and lacy are all great. i'm truly a stan now

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.788): I remember when GUTS came out it was right after my September 2023 canon event and I thought it was the most immature album and a regression of Sour. Six months later, after all the sadness came a huge wave anger and I was living for this album. Oh Olivia Rodrigoat, the pop rock crown is yours.

**curryraejepsen** (8.765): this was always going to be my fave album going into the rate even if some of those bonus tracks are a snooze

**Frajer** (8.676): Sour was such a moment and Guts does a good job of trying to recapture it and Olivia is such a talented artist

**Stryxen** (8.676): there’s a few total chops but the quality of the median song on this makes this probably my fav mainstream pop album in a longggg time

**RandomHypnotica** (8.647): If SOUR was the rushed EP turned into a full album, and GUTS is the first full-fledged album, I cannot WAIT to see how good Olivia's next project will be

**WesternWind** (8.647): god is good, she spilled so much tea here and left us wanting more

**DylanSlayChallenge** (8.618): 9

**nayanasha** (8.594): like a lot of us, I only really like her pop-punk-y songs unfortunately, but they're fantastic

**Ayzrules** (8.565): her ballads are a bit teenager-esque for me, but when she goes hard she goes /hard/. Loved guts overall!

**Baelyana** (8.506): i go back to her very often. what a sophomore showing

**krusso1105** (8.500): Excellent, although a few mid ballads bring the score down a bit

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.471): hooooo boy this album… I feel like I can’t really explain why I love this album because it really boils down to “this is my brat”. It’s fun, it’s flirty, and it’s socially awkward enough to feel like something that can mean something to me. All of the songs are decent, and most of them are good. Sure, it’s not as mature or complex as the other two, but it’s fun!

**daftsone** (8.412): I’d not really listened to Olivia Rodrigo before this, not intentionally, I just never got around to it. Now I’m regretting being late to the party

**donewithbirds** (8.412): i liked sour a lot but WOW what a step up. she listened to me specifically when i kept saying (in my brain to myself) that she should do more stuff like brutal. thank you olivia. for my next request i want more interesting hair and makeup on the red carpet.

**wane them lietoc!** (8.347): Of all the albums here, GUTS is the one that has the best overall MO on paper to me: Olivia digs deeper into alt rock to talk about coming of age as a woman with desires. Her CD mix is somehow bizarrely bad and sounds like a private from the 00s loudness wars shipped back in a coffin with a burple eardrum, but overall does demonstrate she's got the goods.

I went and relistened finally on my lappy and a few more cuts got bumps they need and I recall why I've heard this album like 5 or so times. A) This album couldn't quite exist 20 years ago the way it seems, just in Olivia's assured YA bratiness that Britney more than Avril helped usher & Olivia's alt-radio third eye recesses seems to get. She also brings in a level of reflection that came to define the 2010s pop skool B) While she can't quite dig into indie-recesses, say Olivia has yet to prove she could write Cannonball, she can converse with the present day territory known as Bubblegrunge. Those guys can't write theatre camp ballads like Olivia, but in her (weezer indebted) guitars, you can hear her rocking and running with that very particular strain of guitar pop. One that I hope she can still squeeze some raucous, hedonistic boy-meets-girl and destroys the town tales with to come. Also C) she fucks with iron and wine jfc. (bonus cuts aren't great but as loosies do help to paint what's going on at large, olivia do NOT do country )

**bespectacIed** (8.324): 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭

**dreamingpastel** (8.294): As an overly emotional (elder) Gen Z who likes 90s/00s pop rock, creative writing, and all shades of purple, I just vibe with Olivia's music so much. That aside, this album really builds upon the good parts of Sour, and I can't wait to see where she goes from here.

**Soalai** (8.253): My fave. What can I say, I'm a rock fan first and foremost. Avril was my first main pop girlie.

**welcome2thejam** (8.176): A tale of two Olivias

**Outside-Pianist-5082** (8.153): 8.2

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8.118): Pop-rock done well and this probably my favorite album of these bunch, only a couple of skips and the rest ranges from great to all-time highs.

**ricki** (8.100): she woke up and started writing songs about having embarrassing relationships, hooking up with a guy that you’re starting to resent, being weirdly obsessed with your significant other’s ex, liking gay boys, suicide, and not eating to feel better about yourself….. this is bitch is reading my diary

**Standard-Ad-7249** (8.088): most olivia coded album out there, truly a masterpiece

**bluepupz** (8.059): This rate was my first time listening to the entire album, and I enjoyed it! The first 3 songs are a very strong opener, but my favorite is definitely Vampire. I think I prefer the standard/non-deluxe version, but Obsessed is a fun song too. Good stuff!

**hikk** (8.029): there's still some balladry i don't really care for but she has found her sound i LOVE all the upbeat rocky tracks here and i'm so excited for her next album if she continues in that direction

**jman457** (8.018): A huge improvement from Sour, im really excited for her career as she hopefully just improves her songwriting and musical abilities further.

**arboresca** (8.000): this album is definitely more my style. of the three I was the biggest fan of Olivia going into the rate, and I was obsessed (pun intended) with this album when I first listened to it. I love when Olivia goes rock and so I was really well fed with this album. plus the deluxe has one of my favorite songs ever on it. not at all shocked it's my favorite of the rate, but was nice to revisit and see how my thoughts on it have changed. Favorite: stranger; Least Favorite: vampire",3,2025-04-13 21:28:47

**NervousLemon6670** (8): Remembering that Weird Al covered this to Hazbin Hotel animation

**oh\_crow** (8): this is pretty good but god some of the lyrics are clunky and could have done with another look over BUT i think the instrumental goes in some very exciting places

**Stryxen** (8): her vocals are shockingly perfect for this and i love so many instrumental choices, she’s just a genius i’m afraid.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I've had mixed feelings on this song ever since it came out. Like it's objectively a well-made song, it's just weird to imagine something this… unusual? avant-garde? theater kid-ish? being a hit, but I guess it kinda is and it’s not bad

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (7.9): it’s very good, but it’s also the song on the album that is most transparently trying to follow up drivers license, which makes it hard not to compare them

**Ambrosia42** (7.8): this wasn’t my favorite, but it’s kinda growing on me actually. It gives frantic theater kid energy a bit

**jman457** (7.8): its a good song, fuck what Todd in the shadows said, but there are def better songs here

**Soalai** (7.5): I understand there are some parts that arguably don't work, but it certainly leaves a stark impression

**modulum83** (7.3): it's kinda shitty but in a cunty way i guess

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7): The only great part on this song is the ""blood sucker, fame fucker"" line, everything else is kinda mid.

**donewithbirds** (7): the bridge and final chorus eATS the rest of it is fine

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): you hear a lot about how small sample sizes can lead to conclusions that are not representative of the larger population… and I would like to say that this song has received universal acclaim from my sample size of three Gen Alphas.

**qazz23** (7): not that strong of a hook but really liking the last minute

**stealthamo** (7): Vampire has never fully clicked for me. And yet, every single time I listen to it I feel like I'm close to getting it. Has to count for something, right?

**welcome2thejam** (7): Needed this to be bad so I could say ""is it called vampire because it sucks"" but instead it's okay

# **Team Jacob**

**asadprofessorplum** (6.6): Eating my ass like a goddamn vampire.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): see this is the rare case of a lead single that is actually worse in the context of the album

**human\_performance** (6): I'm just not a fan of the lyrical style of today's pop ballads. I feel like I'm being overwhelmed by the lyrics as the primary means for the artist to express their emotion. If you're gonna go for a dense lyrical style, even Sondheim let the music breathe. But in popular music, less is more

**indie\_fan\_** (6): this has potential but i just can't take the vampire analogy seriously during the hook

**pig-serpent** (6): Classic power ballad issue where it's good once it gets going and bad before. On top of that, the final ""bloodsucker"" is such a lame release of tension and the whole song is just similar enough to Driver's Liscense that I'd rather just listen to that again.

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (5.9): same as bad idea and mostly good but vampire line followed by break ruins the sonic potential

**dreamingpastel** (5): I'm honestly glad bad idea right? was Olivia's next single, because I could stop deluding myself into liking this song. It's not the worst, but there are better songs on Guts.

**flava** (4.5): god this wants to be such a cutting song and it just sounds ridiculous the way it just tries those dynamics, and the melodramatic lyrics just aren’t as fun to scream out when the guy seems like an actual fucking creep, and the description of this guy is creepy in an objective way and not just an ex-boyfriend who she’s shitting on

**arboresca** (4): tries to do too much, not a huge fan—it feels like the build up doesn't really build to anything new/unique. i do like the theatricality of it though, and that video of the different clean version options is hilarious.

**vayyiqra** (4): Mixed feeling on this and always have been; I like some parts and instrumentally it's fine, she sings it fine, I think I don't connect with the lyrics at all but then I'm not really supposed to I guess? I don't get anything out of bitter songs even though it's a valid feeling I guess, but not one I have a lot. Idk where I'm going with this but don't be mad I didn't give it a high score it's just not for me.

**beeozan** (3.3): hope this does as well as vampire weekend in ih ult

**Catalyst** (3): this is where the profanity just sounds dumb and contrived

**seanderlust** (0): goes for the same gut punch as driver's license but misses by a mile. if you're going to do this sort of righteous anger banger ballad, it needs to hit exactly right. this completely swings and misses.

I liked it, and I did have one day where I fell into a time loop and listened to it like 70 times in a row (it has that quality), but never did I imagine it would be the song to just become absolutely massive. Obviously an iconic track that she will probably be remembered for for the rest of her career.

**blueberries929** (9): We all remember where we were.

**darj** (9): if I was rating this the month it dropped, I’d give it a very bored 7, plus some “really?? the Say So rehash??” When this became Sabrina’s long awaited breakout single. Somehow inescapability both offline and online has won me over. it really is a 80s boogie vibe. The chorus is total blissed out Debbie Harry-like post-disco but the dry, low register of the verses almost kinda gives me The Waitresses?! As in the vibe is that early 80s era of when mutant-disco and post-punk were interacting in New York City nightclubs. It’s chic it’s chic. Have to say I prefer daily drip coffee, espresso (for me an oatmilk cortado uwu) is an occasional treat

**dreamingpastel** (9): My favorite line is ""My honeybee, come get this pollen."" There's just something about how Sabrina lays the pet name on thick, before following up with a thematic double entendre.

**nooodisaster** (9): The most annoying person you knew was obsessed with this song. I never willingly listened to it and I have 42 scrobbles. You know what, take the 9 and go Miss Carpenter.

**qazz23** (9): this one grooves, like this catchy throwback disco sound (and nintendo reference)

**runaway3212** (9): Wow the beach has opened, my sandals are on and my bussy is open

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This not being a #1 hit is ridiculous honestly

**emayzee** (8.6): this still feels like such an outlier here

**oh\_crow** (8.5): its just an insanely good pop song almost every aspect of it is absolutely killer. the kind of song that really launches a career. and i dont really like it, its just not my kind of song and i've purposely gone out of my way to listen to it about twice, but i cant deny the moment that it is

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): Classic NINTENDO SWITCH 2 COMING SOON

**Soalai** (8): It took me months to tell the difference between this intro and the intro of Chained to the Rhythm.. who says Katy has no impact

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): a song that achieved the highest honor possible: when it comes on the radio my mom tells me “wait keep that on i like this song”

**jman457** (7.7): just a breezy pop song even if its overplayed/overstayed

**sfouou** (7.5): not really my jam but i get why this was huge

**wane them lietoc!** (7.2): i think having to hear the slate podcast with the dilla time guy about this song in my mom's car made me go ""mhm"". Solid cut that helped us usher in a moment where the popular music canon playlist was adding some nice 2024 additions; there was actual hope for pop music being a popular cultural thing for a second but we're so back to that not mattering

**dys-fx-al** (7): ok I don't really love love this one but it is iconic and I do really love how she says ""cuz I'm a singer""

**innuendo\_overdose** (7): I’m not even the biggest fan of this song (if “cuz I’m a siiiinggeer” has no haters, I am dead etc. etc.), but the first few seconds can’t fail to hype me up

# **Too bad your #5 don’t do it for ya**

**beeozan** (5): i was gonna write a very long comment explaining why i zeroed this song but then she pissed me off with the next song even more. i think this song blows. i dont think her wit and cheeky lyricism (which imo is a bit exaggerated, but like its there, sure) make up for the immensely boring production (and its not just because it is the infiniteth nudisco rehash, i think the bass just kinda doesnt distinguish itself at all and neither do her vocals. theres a bit where near the end theres some vocal layering and even then i find it so boring. i've seen a couple of her live performances of this - mostly against my will - and she sometimes does interesting vocal bits in those, which emphasizes my criticism of the lack of all that in the studio recording for me). i've also sang along to this song when my friends either put it on or like started singing one of the parts randomly and they are sometimes amazed at how much of the lyrics i know lol. it could've been any other song and i would probably prefer that. but it was this one. i have fun enjoying music with my friends despite what this long paragraph would suggest! so i cant bring myself to actually go out of my way to hate on it right now. the power of pop music ig. I do still hate all the online reception of this song when it came out and people were like ""she's bringing fun pop back"" like hello?? if pop was somehow not fun enough for you (despite these people supposedly being music nerds, i must add) all these years cuz you couldnt find it then why do i have to suffer through this slop for a year? make it make sense

**fair-profile-8367** (5): I still love it, but it's become WAY too overplayed for me

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4.5): better song of the record but still not worth reliving

**asadprofessorplum** (0): So there’s this worst song on the album…

**flava** (0): I've had beef with this song for pretty much the entire year. In short I think it's one of the worst songs of the year. I disagree with it on a philosophical level of how I think the worst art is made and what really speaks to me. It hits a veneer of ironic detachment while still trying to maintain an effortless cool that aggravates me. I have similar issues with Nonsense, which is also an awful song for similar reasons and anyone who disliked it was said to “just hate fun” an online way of thinking that implies there is only one way of “being fun” which I'm calling that as bullshit from insecure pop stans. But then the critical establishment bought into Espresso at large and I'm perplexed. It's just Say So but four years later without a sexual predator’s name attached to the production. And like Say So is already a terrible song with its stale, uncolourful disco production, really only redeemed when Doja Cat decides to liven things up in the 2nd verse. Espresso doesn't have that, it has Sabrina singing with a nauseatingly unsettling chorus, trying to get through the song with an effortless vibe that sounds like it comes from a lack of effort rather than her acting abilities. It makes Espresso one of the worst songs of the year, only saved achieving the crown by Camila Cabello and Playboi Carti self-hatred “anthem”. I do not like what the critical establishment falling over themselves in the name of poptimism for Espresso says about them, but it's not like it says anything new about them, just in a more obvious light. I want art to try, to sound like it gives a fuck, to take a swing, a risk. There is none of that in Espresso, leading to it feeling like an empty, hollow song with no aspirations beyond ironic memefication potential because online culture right now finds it easier to engage with stuff that has one basic ass veneers of irony (I have similar issues with the Brat album art), and this is a big reason why being online rn can feel so exhausting because you can put in a lot of effort for something and the disengaged response you get is “you just hate fun music”, like “fun” is some objective quality that can be definitively defined. I don’t find this fun, I find it exhausting, I find it irksome, I find it as just one big giant wink to the camera with nothing much more than that because having any amount of substance isn’t something Sabrina wants to do right now. Music that doesn’t try will always automatically get put in a special zone of disdain, I don’t need high art, I like plastic electro-pop that is made as a product first, art second, but it needs more punch, there needs to be something to grasp onto where I can feel the effort, a cringey try hard line. It’s just Ava Max but if someone managed to sand away at not only her personality, but her conviction!

**nonchalantthoughts** (0): I don’t think I ever hated a song’s guts like this in a while (maybe since Blank Space.) It’s such bland boring nu-disco. This would have been so much fun in quarantine days but like how are you four years late to a trend? And people are eating this up??? There’s no rhythm at all and makes me want to take a nap. Like why does Sabrina sound half asleep? The way I know she can do better but this album’s choice for singles baffle me to no end.",3,2025-04-13 20:41:37

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): this was such a relief after listening to billie omfg…i’m so sorry but this is real music

**dys-fx-al** (9.5): yes bitch

**nooodisaster** (9.5): the irony went go over most of twt's heads but this was a serve .5

**stealthamo** (9.5): After everybody left the pop punk revival in 2021, Olivia is single-handedly carrying it on her back.

**implasdad** (9.2): like the energy, the avril lavigne vibes

**Ayzrules** (9): the melody in the verses is gorgeous! Absolutely love the way she switches so rapidly between the delicate, ethereal vocals and the more intense rock sections

**Baelyana** (9): i'm sexy and i'm kind. i'm pretty when i cry!

**daftsone** (9): America may have gone to shit but this still slaps

**Frajer** (9): more pop girlies should reference The Craft

**ImADudeDuh** (9): idk why i hated this so much before

**jirachi** (9): not british -1

**qazz23** (9): good opener, does the quiet/loud thing well

**slimboyfriend** (9): she can say fuck but not tits? Wake up America!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): >claims to be all-american

>she’s half filipino

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I forgot how hard this album banged honestly

**WesternWind** (9): I don’t remember any American girl dolls having such nerve to call herself a bitch

**NervousLemon6670** (8.7): Olivia dropping those tariffs on all the other artists as we speak

**arboresca** (8.5): god, it's brutal out here, but i'm grateful all the time (for this song)

**Soalai** (8.5): What an opener

**modulum83** (8.2): breaking news: olivia has finally learned her first guitar riff

**beeozan** (8): fun pop rock but we could lose the acoustic guitar verses and go full post-hardcore

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): bitch please, you're better than the Kennedys at this point, go ask the Department of Health right now!

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): Every line on this song is relatable.

**human\_performance** (8): It's strange how much easier I take the stylings of 00s pop-punk, a genre I hated at the time, when delivered through Olivia Rodrigo

**RainbowSherbet47** (8): Ha ha ha nothing bad ever happens to the all-american bitch

**skylofte2** (8): truly in her bag

**team\_kockroach** (8): My favorite part is that transition from the first chorus to verse 2. Her performance on SNL elevated this song for me too.

# **Kidz goes Bop**

**ConnerY2323** (7.7): the edginess on this album is hit or miss for me but i really adore all the switch ups in this

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): her songs About being an American bitch deeply appeal to me a fellow American bitch

**pig-serpent** (7): A rare song where the verses are better than the chorus.

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (6): the melody? great! the lyrics?...it's giving the opening credits song of a dcom about an angsty teen girl with a preppy older sister who she has to learn to appreciate and vice versa

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (5.7): Not as banger an opener as ""brutal"" (a top Liv song for me), but I really love some of the lyrical wit around American culture. Also a good tonal set up for the album as a whole.

**goodbyesindisguise** (5): great opener just not my kind of song

**vayyiqra** (5): This is Electra Heart lyrics over a 90s power-pop instrumental, I'm serious.

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4.8): obnoxious chorus overpowering the rest of the good bits

**asadprofessorplum** (4): This just sounds like getting on a public bus that’s crowded with high schoolers.

**Able-Scene6741** (10): the more you listen the more morbid it becomes :)

**akanewasright** (10): it would frankly be a minor eyeroll from me if this won, but it kind of is *that* good. It feels like a more optimistic update of the vulnerable songwriting that in songs like “Halley’s Comet” and “i love you,” two of my other favorite songs she’s ever made. And also… That second verse is just a gut punch to me. I’ve loved so many people who are so obviously beautiful inside and out, but who can only see the worst in themselves, and I can *feel* the way Billie delivers those lines in my soul. It’s just a perfect song delivered perfectly

**beeozan** (10): yeah it is that bitch

**bigbigbee** (10): My other 11 contender. I think this song is just so gorgeous. I remember listening to HMHAS last year and nothing was connecting until this came on. I've come to like Chihiro, but this really does stand out as the crown jewel of the album for me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t know what specific element of this song it is, but man it really does feel like an immediate classic.

**Broshi** (10): (Yoshi's note: Rn he's playing Witcher 3 and singing along)

**buildingigloos** (10): Probably winning, but it would be deserved

**ConnerY2323** (10): billie is a master of the weird middle ground between happy and sad. this is such a breezy, springy song and yet there’s all that melancholy threaded into its seams.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i feel like i have become lighter than air and ascended beyond my body

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Gorgeous song

**dreamingpastel** (10): Far and away the best song on the album. I sometimes think about Todd in the Shadow's comments on this song, particularly on how immediately timeless it is, and yeah. The shadow man is right.

**Frajer** (10): Finneas really put his whole Finnussy into this one

**goodbyesindisguise** (10): flawless song and deserved the streaming success it has had. it’s simply gorgeous

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is already a classic

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I'm rooting for Sabrina, but if this wins, I won't be mad, it's deserving of a crown

**ImADudeDuh** (10): legitimately timeless. Absolutely beautiful.

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): the drumming in the prechorus (or is it the chorus? this song too good for structure) ties the whole thing together and makes me stop, and think. acoustic guitar excellency

**jman457** (10): Like Todd in the shadows said, this already sounds like a classic.

**krusso1105** (10): another 11 runner up

**NervousLemon6670** (10): My favourite bird is a rockhopper penguin, idk what my favourite feather is

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): oh everything about this song is so airy and light

**nooodisaster** (10): this would be a 11 except for that mv (i have never seen the mv)

**pbk** (10): this is genuinely going to go down in history as one of the most timeless classics of the 21st century

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it sends me that this song about loving someone til they're in the grave was first teased in the mushy wushy sunshines and puppies Heartstopper

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The same way that without warning, a stranger can become someone whose sheer presence makes you feel invincible, my emotions around this song flipped from ""basic ballad"" to ""modern standard of timeless beauty"". Weddings, funerals, graduations, etc

**skylofte2** (10): mother behavior

**Straight-Meaning** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG

**Stryxen** (10): this really gets me kfjglfgj i dont wanna 10 cuz godlivia or saqueena deserve their first wins but my god

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): alongside espresso, what was 2024 without this song??? fan edits were never the same again

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): a huge moment for old people sayings

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I was not at all hype for HMHAS until a snippet of this song showed up in the Heartstopper teaser trailer before the album’s release and I was instantly obsessed. This song absolutely deserves to go down as her biggest hit

**UselessTacooo** (10): I saw someone this sounds like it’s existed for 50 years, and while that sounds like a drag to a popper-brain r/popheads user, it’s so accurate. Something about the melody makes the track feel like a classic that’s been around for centuries. I hear no Billie here, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I think we will be hearing this for the rest of our lives, and that’s okay

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I just want to hear more happy Billie. Like yes sad dark brooding Billie is classic, but something about the sad dark brooding Billie writing a sincere and beautiful ballad is just… it warms my heart so much

**wathombe** (10): this and ""lunch"" were the two tracks that grabbed me on first listen when the album dropped, and they're still top two for me

**welcome2thejam** (10): Alright fine, I'll start yearning, god

**WesternWind** (10): meanwhile Sabrina said that she feels so much lighter like a feather without her partner

**Baelyana** (9.9): timeless

**dys-fx-al** (9.9): this song is almost perfect to me

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (9.5): As Edward Cullen might say, ""Effervescent."" I didn't get the hype for this song at first, but no, it hit me eventually. You could say it hit me hard and soft... ba dum tss. But no, there's something so airy and heartening about this track. Instant pick me up, and a nice change of pace for Billie who usually stays in the slower, darker lane. Helps keep the album moving immensely.

**seanderlust** (9.5): this getting so popular with the GP is amazing given how morbid some of the lyrics are. this truly does feel like a new classic - a song we'll be hearing at weddings in ten, twenty years from now

**Treecoh** (9.5): Never understood the hype for this song but it grew on me the more I heard it on radio. I still can't give it a 10 tho!

**Ambrosia42** (9): the random song I actually like

**emayzee** (9): there's unfortunately a bit of overplay bias here

**FitzMarble** (9): oh ICONIC

**pig-serpent** (9): That guitar creates the perfect splash of psychedelia to make this song sound incredibly rich and full. An obvious standout for this album and perfectly deserving of being her highest rated song.

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.5): I mean what else is there to say about this song except that it is actually quite depressing and wistful

**Soalai** (8.5): That guitar is so pretty. Unique production that really immerses you

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): A Classic that reminds me of Tokyo Toni

**vayyiqra** (8): 🪶

**wane them lietoc!** (7.8): really its her smoochiest song to date. that bro in the chiaroscuro hit it there good. this is some kid's radiohead - high and dry or

**implasdad** (7.5): very popular with the punters. maybe i’ve heard it too much on the radio

**curryraejepsen** (7.3): i don't mind it but it is SO overplayed i'm a bit sick of it

**Awkward\_King** (7): a good pop song. unfortunately i dont have many thoughts on it beyond that. very pretty and twinkly. but also a little grating and cliche. but it is exciting to see billie get a new signature song.

**bogo** (7): this is by far the billie song i’m most frustrated by cause like on one hand i can't deny that it's good, but on the other hand to me it's just so ill-fitting for an artist like billie. i don't mean to say she's only good at the understated whisper sung dark pop style but like, i just feel like she's completely out of her wheelhouse on a song this maximalist and light, it just doesn't feel completely genuine to me. it feels like a song catered towards people who don't like billie eilish

**human\_performance** (7): the hooks here feel very Miguel. I'd just rather listen to Miguel

**qazz23** (7): beautiful vocals and harmonies but doesn't really stand out",2,2025-04-13 21:16:27
Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1jydu00,Gen Z Royalty Day 3: Don't Wanna Say Goodbyyyyyyyyyeee To My 11 When It Diiiiiiiiiiiiiies,mmymbs1,camerinian,"**Ayzrules** (7.960): yeah i don’t love this kind of music. The floaty atmospheric vibe doesn’t work for me unless there is a nice beat to go with it and/or a strong melody (a la ocean eyes, which has both), and the first 2/3 of the album did not have enough of that to keep me engaged and listening. However, there were still a few tracks that i found quite nice and not complete snoozers, and it was interesting to listen through the album, even if it wasn’t quite to my taste. I thought the general haunting, eerie-but-lush air to it was unique and pretty much classic billie

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.950): I don’t have many thoughts about this album! It’s very consistent, and I think Finneas hit it out of the park with how good his production is at conveying a sense of Ghibli dreamliness.

**asadprofessorplum** (7.950): It’s not a bad album whatsoever but honestly this Billie era feels like a filler arc.

**curryraejepsen** (7.940): this rate was my first time listening to this full album and it def exceeded my expectations i mean the music was good

**dys-fx-al** (7.840): i think i rated this album higher than I expected? the sequencing is done so well

**team\_kockroach** (7.750): Billie’s best album to date. It has so many creative ideas on it, and Billie and Finneas are so ambitious with it even though the execution misses the mark just a little bit. I’m so happy this was as commercially successful as it was.

**oh\_crow** (7.750): i listened to this a lot around its release, coming back to it a decent bit later now it feels a lot more uneven than i remember, a few of these songs wore their welcome for me quickly. but i think when i take a step back and look at billie's wider discography i appreciate the scope and ambition and i really feel like she's got a masterpiece or two in her, even if i dont believe she's reached it yet

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7.750): it's ""spring awakening"" if Wendla was gen-z like you could slot ""whispering"" into this tracklist and it wouldn't stick out. sometimes the cohesion cohered a little too much but. my main beef is that I don't rate her or Finneas very highly as lyricists. most of the lyrics are just adequate and sometimes what's going on musically either isn't enough to make up for it or is let down by the uninspiring lyrics. I also don't think that any of the song switch-ups were as effective as ""hte.""

**beeozan** (7.730): complain about the overreliance on the beat switches all you want but when she released this album with somehow interesting production (she is trying to arrive at her own kind of post-pop and imo mostly failing in the process but i appreciate the attempt) she threw a liferaft to a popheads subreddit drowning in ttpd discourse and the boringness that came with. for that i will be forever thankful

**letsallpoo** (7.700): billie throwing in a tempo switchup for the sixth song in a row https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ-pQojAnaM

**flava** (7.700): probably her worst album but still good

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.700): So I listened to this album once when it came out and didn’t listen to it again until now. I’m glad to hear that it’s even better than I remembered, and it shows just how skilled and innovative Billie is as a musician.

**Baelyana** (7.640): another stunner billie

**WesternWind** (7.600): she’s got some great tracks and ideas here, but why is it so quiet at times??

**DirtyRat583** (7.590): ok lowkey i forgot how ballady this album was..... still an insane 3 track run at least

**jman457** (7.530): There are great songs here, but also drags a bit in the back half. Also its been overplayed to death at school, like please find a new obsession. Happier than ever still remains her magnum opus in my eyes

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.470): I don’t know why I never got around finishing this album but it is very light and airy. I can see myself enjoying this a lot more if i gave it more listens. But overall, I enjoyed it! :)

**arboresca** (7.450): this was my first ever listen to this album. it got lost in the music overload of spring 2024 and I never got around to it, and wow. my feelings about this album are interesting. on one hand I think it's an art piece, I think it's brilliant, I think the storytelling is amazing. the production is experimental and out of my norm but i really enjoyed it, all the different styles and sounds kept things fresh. on the other, I can't see myself revisiting many of these songs often. this feels like an album you have to listen to all at once, or else you lose parts of the story, & even the songs i didn't love have their place in the overall story. overall, though, this one's gonna sit with me for a while. Favorites: SKINNY & BLUE; Least Favorite: THE DINER

**modulum83** (7.430): I'm on record as having Happier Than Ever as one of my favorite pop albums of the decade - a liminal, haunted exploration of trauma that I found completely enchanting. HMHAS is a relatively more cleaned-up affair, an....artsy singer-songwriter album largely about exploring romantic frustration. On the one hand, I do respect it immensely for pushing her sound further and taking it to a more stadium-size, ""timeless"" place - the production on this album is some of the most insane shit I have heard in mainstream pop. On the other hand, those ideas never quite cohere into something beyond cool aesthetic, it has that Kanye syndrome where the style and ""genius"" are only there to make everything bigger, where the cracks begin to show under the surface. But the bigger issue is that despite having some of her best songwriting and unique sonic identities, you've never felt so distant from Billie herself. It's smoothed out and glossy, sinuous watery Grammy-bait that is more cinematic experience than songs.

**dreamingpastel** (7.400): Tragically, this isn't my favorite Billie album. It's not bad, but I feel like I keep trying to listen to this album and lose interest midway through. Sorry to Billie and other slow song enjoyers. I have failed you all.

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7.220): I enjoyed this album on first listen, but didn't expect it to grow on me or eclipse HTE. Holy smokes, did I speak to soon. It's a beautiful, rich production from start to finish, avoids being too same-y, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It explores some new themes for Billie while also retreading old, classic tricks (""THE GREATEST"" does pull the same explosion as ""Happier Than Ever,"" and guess what! I liked it both times!!). There are some weaker moments for me, but overall, I think this is a true piece of sonic artwork. I wouldn't be surprised if in another year or two, this one comes out on top in my personal esteem.

**akanewasright** (7.200): by far my least favorite here. Rating doesn’t do my apathy towards most of this album justice, because nothing is really BAD, just… only a few songs worth more than a shrug. “BOAF” does break my heart and stitch it back together though

**qazz23** (7.100): i liked the production and the dark, minimal bass sounds though a few tracks didn't hit quite as hard (lol)

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7.100): I thought the latter half was much more interesting and stronger then the first half but I really do think instead of a ‘return to form’ some people view this as, I feel like Billie has become very predictable and repetitive both in themes and lyricism that her art suffers from.

**ktajlili** (7.000): When Billie Eilish released HIT ME HARD AND SOFT with only 10 tracks, it seemed like almost a rebellion. With pop stars like Morgan Wallen, Drake and Taylor Swift releasing behemoth albums, Billie's conservative approach to releasing music seems almost counterintuitive to the mainstream sales strategy. But where her previous record was somewhat bloated, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT trim tracklist wastes no time. IMO, songs like ""SKINNY"" and ""THE GREATEST"" retread themes and sonic directions explored on previous albums, but less successfully, while others like ""BITTERSUITE"" and ""THE DINER"" take a shot at something and miss. It's not my favorite Billie album, but when it hits, it hits hard.",1,2025-04-13 21:25:54

**daftsone** (6): It’s sort of a love letter to the 80s, but written by someone who heard about it through a friend

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (5.5): I had to listen to this song so many times bc I just didn’t grab me. But I do appreciate pop acts especially talking about the fifteen minutes of fame and how fake everyone who were at best apathetic to you before your 15 minutes.

**camerinian** (9.5): the funny girl is often the hottest on in the room, sabrina just gets it! Such a shame the softness of the instrumental didn’t quite drive the tune home for enough people, but this is a day 3 staple in my heart, the comedy lines are juuuuuuuuust on the edge of being really eyeroll-worthy but they’re not, and they only help the seductive atmosphere instead of hindering it.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): This was a standout for me from the first listen of Short ‘n Sweet! The bassline is so delicious, and the whole thing is such a dreamy listen! This and #15 were swapping places for the back half of the rate, and it just barely missed out here. 

**impla77** (8.9): Such a sexy bass line gives a great backing to this song, especially paired with the obligatory ultra horny lyrics. I’m not sure how I feel about the second verse and bridge being so wink wink. I mean I appreciate Sabrina’s commitment to the bit I guess, and her more humorous lyrics do set her apart from her fellow popstars but come on… this could’ve been so sleek and we’re making a 69 joke? And you’re reminding me of the existence of Fahrenheit? That’s the real crime here.

# **Chemists**

**Ambrosia42** (10): where art thou? Why not uponeth me? I love the songwriting so much lmao there are so many good lines in this one

**asadprofessorplum** (10): Sabrina Carpenter is just Weird Al with overdrawn lip liner.

**babadork** (10): Everyone needs to look up Barry Keoghan’s white jacket. I think it’s terrible, but I’m open to hearing other opinions

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What the hell happened to the music video we were supposed to get for this??

**buildingigloos** (10): If this isn't influenced by Arianas Positions, I'll eat crow

**CrimsonROSET** (10): WHO’STHEBOYWITHTHEWHITEJACKETANDTHETHICKACCENT

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): “come ride on me, I mean camaraderie”. My god, she’s my Shakespeare

**Frajer** (10): my brain every time Bad Chemical Romance

**ignitethephoenix** (10): we love a song about being railed by Dr. Doofenshmirtz

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): “we’ll both arrive at the same time” is a line that for ages I really hated, cuz I thought like you’d arrive at the same time at the place? That doesn’t make much sense it’s not much of a good romantic line that both of them would come toget-OH!! I’m stupid!!

**kauai6** (10): i can only think about k-pop men edits to this song

**Lynflower680** (10): “A little fade out” that gave me a good chuckle

**modulum83** (10): british people having sex be like ""good heavens i'm arriving""

**runaway3212** (10): Shakespeare could've never thought to write ""where art thou"" it was not in his vocabulary

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): so Bedtime Stories/Erotica Madonna coded, with a lighter touch

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): honestly like top 3 sabrina song

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): A lil goofy a lil horny a lil gorgeous, that's the Short n' Sweet way

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): It doesn't surprise me that this is r/pophead’s favorite song… It's basically a horny Carly Rae Jepsen track

**wathombe** (10): still more clever and sexy wordplay wrapped in a dreamy 80s throwback

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (9.7): the production on this song is near perfect

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): me and who 👀

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): groovy and horny and funny. the austin powers soundtrack song that got away

**FluffyNobody** (9.5): The only word I can think of to describe it is ""sparkly""

**1998tweety** (9): i cant not think of that Chowder meme when I hear this song

**bespectacIed** (9): Horny ... nearly to the point of impropriety. But I love me an 80s pastiche that doesn't insist upon itself

**Brilliant-Primary500** (9): why is this NOT a single? It literally top ten hit material. Also, who's the cute boy with the white jacket and a cute accent? Not me, unfortunately. It's all in my head, I'm very batshit crazy. I suck at bed chem and that probably why I can't have a boyfriend who stays longer at this point.

**Catalyst** (9): very Tamia's So Into You-coded

**donewithbirds** (9): the nonsense outros becoming popular is one of the best things to happen for pop music in the last couple years i'm not joking

**jirachi** (9): COME RIGHT ON ME- I MEAN CAMARADERIE

**jonathanadr13** (9): still don't know what she's saying in the chorus but you know i'm living for it every time

**letsallpoo** (9): I really appreciate how she avoids saying ""wherefore art thou"". I'm sure someone grammatically challenged on her team pushed for that

**nonchalantthoughts** (9): this class wasn’t offerred to me as a chemistry major

**qazz23** (9): some funny wordplay in this, also like the funky guitar and R&B sound

**ricki** (9): i cant find it right but imagine i linked the video of ai kim jong un in girly outfits dancing to this

**wane them lietoc!** (9): this is basically a craft spells instrumental. jack tatum should've taken out Blake Mills so he could've written something like this for Michelle on the last jbrekkie album

**welcome2thejam** (9): She's the 2015 Steph Curry of sex puns

**blueberries929** (8.9): See it in my mind let's fulfill the prophecyyyy don't want money just someone who wants my companyyyy

**jman457** (8.6): just lets her voice and vibes shine

**Baelyana** (8.5): slick

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.5): groovy af, the vocals are vocaling, she's got jokes, she's got seduction. would be the ur-sabrina song if ""espresso"" didn't exist

**stealthamo** (8.5): Please, more artistic horny lines like ""Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?""

**bigbigbee** (8): Has the instrumental of a SNSD b-side from 2009, though nothing else about it resembles those songs

**bogo** (8): i’d say shakespeare never wrote a line as powerful as “where art thou why not uponneth me” but let's be real that man has written some horny ass shit

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this being the single instead of Juno oh don’t pmo

**NervousLemon6670** (8): Doing chemistry in the bed and my partner is waiting for me but I dropped the test tube yet again, I'm real bad at this

**nooodisaster** (8): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GMAI6G1acAAxX_p.jpg

**vayyiqra** (8): This sound is a lot closer to what I wanted from this album than the two before it, that's for sure

**WesternWind** (8): me and who??

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): [whose the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent](https://imgur.com/a/lvlJ1zC)

**Soalai** (7.5): If we're going by the Brit Awards performance it would be higher!

**implasdad** (7.3): well produced, well put together, but a bit generic

**arboresca** (7): also feels a little like an Ariana reject but I love the lyrics, get it

**daftsone** (7): Fun and sultry, kind of embodies everything Sabrina is on this album

**human\_performance** (7): solid song with a lot of classic R&B influence, with an Isley Brothers inspired bass line

**IIIHenryIII** (7): what about bad bed chem?

**oh\_crow** (7): the chorus scratches an itch i have no idea whats she's saying tho its from the ariana school of enunciation

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): Kinda not as good as I remembered it

**Stryxen** (7): the fact people still call this bad chem to this day for some reason

**team\_kockroach** (7): pretty cool execution of Ariana Grande’s usual songwriting formula. I could see Sabrina’s vocal runs grating on me on future listens though",7,2025-04-12 21:09:20

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): congrats to WILDFLOWER for the win! we’re not revealing the remaining 19 songs!

this placement is rotten actually I never thought my 11 would be down in the dumps with no chance of making day 3? not even an 8 average? y’all are foul and rotten! this wasn’t my fave from the first listen - that was BIRDS OF A FEATHER, but this just sneaked up on me on a random winter day and became one of the most devastating songs I’ve ever heard. It’s so wistful, so beautiful, and I might have cried several times to this song! To see it out here is preposterous and I’m not gonna stand here for this! The COLORS show that she did for this is so beautiful too check that one out…

**impla77** (7.7): ALERT ALERT! HOST 11 DOWN. and MORE IMPORTANTLY IMPLA’S DAD 11 DOWN! Damn this one was surprisingly divisive for what I think is a beautiful if slightly underwhelming ballad. This one just washes over me without much resistance. Everytime I listen to this I’m like yeah I like this it’s pretty, but it doesn’t really stick with me after that. Still, with 7 11s going out here, I’m sure this elimination is going to ruffle some feathers.

**camerinian** (7): I see both sides of this one, like I get why it’s taken off as the late-arriving tiktok smash cos the melody really is captivating in parts, and yet i can’t help but feel like it does sorta wash over me in places. It’s a gorgeous piece that never fully captivates me, and I apologise wholeheartedly to my co-host for this transgression

# **Crossed the line**


**implasdad** (11): really nice to listen to. love the fade in and fade out, really takes me back to the 1970s

**jonathanadr13** (11): I couldn't not give the top score to this song. The melodies (particularly the pre-chorus and chorus) and Billie's delivery just DO it for me. Honestly a perfect song and deserves everything.

**Standard-Ad-7249** (11): billie's best song, argue with the wall

**Able-Scene6741** (10): damn

**asadprofessorplum** (10): Damn is the Clairussy that good?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What do you MEAN the general public made this 4 minute multi-phased deepcut ballad a hit without it even having an music video?? You really don’t see that kind of collective good taste very often.

**daftsone** (10): The outro to this track is just hauntingly powerful

**FakeMonaLisa28** (10): I need more songs like this from Billie

**Frajer** (10): Billie singing about men- I might have sex with your dad, Billie singing about women- the most beautiful song you've ever heard

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is a top tier song about breaking the girl code

**jirachi** (10): fuck.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): good lord

**wathombe** (10): beautiful, soulful, and sneaky

**emayzee** (9.5): need a full album of her being in her indie bag like this and skinny

**ConnerY2323** (9): i’m running out of pretentious ways to say how much i love these songs

**donewithbirds** (9): you don't want me to get on my soapbox about the jesse rutherford thing and how the internet will always find a way to make something a woman's fault even if the reason they're mad at her is checks notes being the vulnerable party in a predatory relationship because i'll be here for literal days so. great song!

**NervousLemon6670** (9): I guess this is what the girlfriend from ""Taste"" is experiencing

**Straight-Meaning** (9): A slow-burn song that is beautiful, especially with the crescendo that happens later.

**arboresca** (8.5): this rate is showing me what I really want from Billie and that's apparently soul crushingly sad songs, love this one

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.5): The “Only made us closer until July” genuinely made me gasp and go “What happened in July??” out loud like it was a soap opera or something

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): thisisaprettygoodsong, notmuchtosayatthispoint.

**FitzMarble** (8): this is pretty good!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Pretty voice…

**WesternWind** (8): beautiful song but she doesn’t say wildflower at all in this song. Bad Billie

**blueberries929** (7.8): Y'all this song is good, but is it really THAT good? Like how did this become a hit when The Greatest is right there

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Beautiful, haunting, stunning, a lil boring.

**pbk** (7.5): this one's just nice :comfy:

**CrimsonROSET** (7): will this get balladphobiad even when its about wlw

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7): the lyrics are a little too indistinct, but she sounds beautiful and idk what the correct term is because I didn't fucking go to school for music theory but I really like the tension between the note she's singing on ""mind/time"" and the chord. if that makes sense

**kauai6** (7): a vibe

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): But not Wildfire

**Soalai** (7): I like the production and the echoes in the background. Also definitely watch her recent performance of this at the iHeart Awards. As I write this, this song is blowing up

**UselessTacooo** (7): not sure why this is the song we chose to make popular but sure why not

**vayyiqra** (7): 🌸😔

**wane them lietoc!** (6.8): oh yeah she just straight up does right of center soccer mommy. you can tell its right of center because of how she handles the first drop. not punk enough",5,2025-04-12 20:30:11

**camerinian** (7.5): while this is lacking in some of the killer turns of phrase the album otherwise packs, i just love the sound on this thing so much, the impact into the hook and the drumline is such an underrated moment from this thing

**impla77** (6.7): Another deeply frustrating song for me tbh. There just seems to be a lot of different ideas and I think a lot of them could work… on their own. But all together its a bit of a mishmash that doesn’t thoroughly explore the musical ideas being offered up. Also I think it’s so disappointing how the ‘We never talk about it’ doesn’t really go anywhere… it just kinda stagnates there and it really could be such a poignant moment if it led to anything! I like the lyrics here but altogether it just doesn’t work for me.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): How did this get into day 2 um…. It’s an okay song, the “we never talk about it” part is nice but it’s pretty much the only memorable thing to it! It shouldn’t have gotten all the way to day 2.. #justiceforlacy

# **LE SSERAFIM - Smart**

**bogo** (10): it's tracks like these that keep me renewing my jack antonoff defender card every year

**darj** (10): this song cracked me the fuck up when I first heard it the weekend the album dropped. Those opening plucked guitar I was like “WHY is Sabrina “Espresso” Carpenter giving us a 2000s Andrew Bird or Sufjan Stevens song lmaooo”. Gonna assume Jack went in a nostalgia bender rewatching Garden State the weekend he worked on this one. I could curate and host the dumbest and funniest “go white boy go” 2000s Sub Pop indie folk grab bag tbh, Iron and W11ne

**nooodisaster** (10): miss jack still got it, the production is haunting and driving yet an earworm. i love how weird and specific amy & sabrina write this song, but of course give us a universal chorus: ""we dont talk about it"".

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she took taylor's 1989 nachos and reheated them better than taylor did on the TV tracks

**Straight-Meaning** (10): She ate this one so bad

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): The only reason this isn't the 11 is I keep misremembering it as having the car drove itself from LA to her thighs line but it doesn't and I always get slightly miffed that it doesn't

**welcome2thejam** (10): Indie folk pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter does it again

**modulum83** (9.7): ok i'm sorry for ever doubting you jack antonoff i bought 15 TTPD vinyls as penance

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): Sabrina’s BF in this song

**NervousLemon6670** (9.2): Sabrina is the right age for this to be a deliberate Shrek reference, consider that

**Able-Scene6741** (9): very underrated

**akanewasright** (9): the biggest grower on the album for me

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I hate how it loses momentum in the chorus

**skylofte2** (9): this is the best song on the album but y'all aren't ready for that convo...

**wane them lietoc!** (9): CRUCIAL SUPPORT 9 FOR SABRINA FOLK VIBE POP

**innuendo\_overdose** (8.9): “we never talk about it” sounds like it’s cribbed from Geez louise! (vote cyberrock please please please) but the fact that it doesn’t make me immediately want to go listen to Wallsocket is a testament to something

**arboresca** (8.5): lyrics hit hard for anyone getting out of a situationship, if that was casual I'm definitely an idiot

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): This might be the prettiest song I’ve ever heard about calling someone a dumbass

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.5): golden retriever boyfriend (derogatory)

**Frajer** (8.5): somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.5): ""how many thing""'s older, prettier sister. love how she ascends the scale in the chorus, love the repetition, love the guitar in the background. her ballads are so slept on

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): incredible delivery in the bridge

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is such a funny song god humour is so underutilised in most songs. sabrina really nailed it here. dumb men >>>

**buildingigloos** (8): Its giving Taylor a little bit. Especially the pre chorus, it's giving the bridge to Style but as a full song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if anyone makes a smash mouth joke in this rate i am going to-

**curryraejepsen** (8): this would not feel out of place on Guts honestly

**daftsone** (8): Simply good pop music

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): the guitar makes me really interested in an acoustic performance from her!

**donewithbirds** (8): love the finger picked guitar line and the chorus, don't love how the bridge sounds like my headphones are malfunctioning

**dys-fx-al** (8): the shade is top tier

**FluffyNobody** (8): I like how she reads her ex for dirt in this album - this is not the best diss track but it's nice

**kauai6** (8): it’s cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute it’s not spectacular

**runaway3212** (8): Me talking about myself

**Soalai** (8): These strings... did Aaron Dessner produce this

**team\_kockroach** (8): Antonoff put some nice-ass sub-bass in these strings, and the vocal panning is fantastic on headphones. Shame it’s a little under-written though.

**wathombe** (8): goes a little long, but a sneaky good track

**Baelyana** (7.9): shawn mendes get up

**Ambrosia42** (7.8): it seems like unfortunately he isn’t a lovable himbo and he is just dumb

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): Shawn Mendes would ruin my life too

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7.6): I love how it gets progressively more emotional and pitched-up over the course of the pre-chorus and chorus. And going ""seems like overnight I'm just the BITCH you haaaate now"" is extremely satisfying.

**blueberries929** (7.5): ""Then a bird flies by and you forget"" raised her score by at least a full point

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): smashmouth homage

**Stryxen** (7.5): this sounds Shady but really like the drop with we never talk about ittt being disappointing and weak cuz it evokes like their awkward silence conceptually tea

**ConnerY2323** (7.4): breezy and effortless

**jman457** (7.2): Its a cute song, but I wish it built to an explosive guitar part for the first chorus.

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**oh\_crow** (7): some of the production choices on this are really gorgeous, and some are a little questionable like some of the effects on her voice are a little strange. i'm overall leaning towards enjoying it

**qazz23** (7): liked the plucked violin sounds

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sabrina's music is like a case study in why the idealization of himbos is actually a bad thing in this essay I will

**WesternWind** (7): so what, if he's pretty enough go for it Sabrina",3,2025-04-12 19:15:20

**impla77** (7.5): Billie turns up much sooner in Day 2 with a song that I enjoy, but I can see why people are not vibing with this in comparison with the rest of the album. It definitely is quite gimmicky and I need to be in a specific mood to fully enjoy this one but when it hits it hits! For some reason I always think of Ratatouille when I hear this song lol

**camerinian** (5): as good as a dub-inflected billie song should be in theory, to be honest I just think this sounds lame, the squeaking sound effects are rather annoying and the narrative is not really compelling enough to make up for the weird execution

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): The only real stinker from HMHAS for me! I was never a fan of When We Fall Asleep.. (outside of the godly i love you) and this reminds me too much of that album’s worst tendency to just be creepy for the sake of it. Also some of the vocals here…. woah. Not good!

—

# **5 Michelin Stars**

**bogo** (10): “i left a calling card so they would know that it was me” omg just like in persona-[trapdoor opens]

**Catalyst** (10): The I'll be Watching You and a touch of that 867-5309 for the Zoomers

**CrimsonROSET** (10): was looking for something to eat, found this beat and ended causing world wide famine

**daftsone** (10): Stalkers don’t deserve such a good song about them

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the sinister homocidial hop, not everyone is gonna get it

**darj** (10): this sounds like a song that would play in a 2000s Cedric Klapisch movie, and even if I’m the only person who has this specific need, #ThankYouBillieEillish

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): very creepy song about a creepy thing she and many others go through. I do hope none of her stalkers take this as a sign or anything. I do like how the álbum both sonically and lyrically refer the beginning with the food theme continuing

**fair-profile-8367** (10): This is song is as incredible as it is terrifying

**goodbyesindisguise** (10): I love clown music

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love how silly and carefree this sounds, it's almost like a parody. Also, this is inherently a Billie song, which we can't say the same about most of the tracks on this album

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): depending on my mood I may go as far as to call this the only genuinely great song Billie Eilish has ever written, lyrically. pop songwriting always has “the narrator feels” “the narrator says” but this is the first Billie song that’s obviously a narrator, like obviously it’s a one guy. queasy pov characters is the exact sort of thing that pop songwriters need to utilise more, this song is maybe the best thing ever made.

**qazz23** (10): this dark, minimal bass-led sound works well here

**RainbowSherbet47** (10): Y’all do we think it’s the same diner from the Telephone music video or the Want U Back music video?

**runaway3212** (10): ohhhh the cunt the cunt the cunt we need billie to collab with E. Gadd more often

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): The best set of lyrics on any pop song of 2024. I mean seriously, who else is even close to her level

**UselessTacooo** (10): feeling SKINNY because the LUNCH is BITTERSUITE at THE DINER

**WesternWind** (10): I am free on tuesdays Billie, meet me at the local Waffle House

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (9.8): this is the most creative song on the album in my opinion

**Able-Scene6741** (9.5): if people are allowed to play you’re beautiful & every breath you take at weddings then I want this stalker bop to play this at my wedding

**ConnerY2323** (9.5): this would’ve SMASHED in the background of a grey’s anatomy scene in 2008 where some lesbians hooked up in a medical closet

**buildingigloos** (9): ookie spookie

**donewithbirds** (9): underrated gem!! the atmosphere is so so good

**FluffyNobody** (9): creepy unsettling Billie has always been my favourite Billie

**krusso1105** (9): Everyone else seems to think this is the weakest on the album but I love it

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): not crazy about the outro but otherwise this is still one of my favourites it's haunting and sexy and wobbly and enticing

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.5): bring out the motherfucking clowns

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.5): okay Lola from ""the loved ones""! love the spooky vibe with the little synths in the background that sound like squeaky laughter

**NervousLemon6670** (8.5): Stan from Eminem if he was born 20 years later

**wathombe** (8.5): sneaky good

**implasdad** (8): i quite like the arabic/eastern feel to it with the minor key

**jirachi** (8): ooo she’s so spooky ooky oh i’m sooo scaredddd

**oh\_crow** (8): this is so WWAFAWDWG coded (god i remember after that album released and i used to see that acronym all the time and i felt a bit insane) good good song anyways

**pig-serpent** (8): Having a goth day while chilling by yourself at a French cafe on the corner.

**ricki** (8): awful first date

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): Stalkers are scary

**Stryxen** (8): the dark cabaret deconstructed atmospheric electroclash bop that scared gracie out the rate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this grew on me alot

**Baelyana** (7.5): personally i thought it slayed but controversial take i think

**wane them lietoc!** (7.5): she could be my ladytron

**Soalai** (7.3): I like the sinister vibe

**blueberries929** (7.2): If we had more decimal places I would've given it 3.108073956 for the bit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I was a little surprised this album ended being my highest average in the rate, but it’s mainly because the worst this album gets for me is a fun but underdeveloped bop. The other two albums have at least one outright stinker.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7): this is alright, but this is easily one of the album's shortest and weakest point.

**FitzMarble** (7): blondie (band, not Taylor) outsold

**jman457** (7): cute lil song

**vayyiqra** (7): Gen Z Blondie - One Way or Another

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I do like a Billie song that sounds like a supervillain theme

**beeozan** (6.8): what in the italian movie music

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): I’m the only fan of this song on this hosting team LMAOOOO. Idc it’s a fun bop, I’m always a good sucker for a good R&B influenced pop song, and it’s just a good time!

**camerinian** (5): this song stands out in such a weird way to the rest of the album, why did she need the ariana style 00s pop cut when the rest of the album is so much smoother than this? why is the attitude so much more sour than the loose goofiness that she at least attempted everywhere else?

**impla77** (4): I really don’t like this track at all lol. The vocals at the beginning are emulating Ari so much its almost uncanny valley. It just feels all very generic, I hate the post chorus and is just disappointing generally. This is basically Busy Woman (non bonus version) in lyrical content and I guess this is just a subject that causes me to roll my eyes in general. If girl I’ve always been wasn’t here (I’m referencing this fucking song so much omg its like my white whale) this would be my 0 because it is viscerally irritating to me.

# **In good graces**


**buildingigloos** (11): The way she sings the verses really reminds me of how Britney sings the verses of Hold It Against Me. I thought she'd done it on purpose but there's no interpolations credited. I love the guitar plucks as well, very 2000s R&B. This neeeeeeeds an mv

**Ambrosia42** (10): it’s a banger. The miami bass influence is fun

**bespectacIed** (10): Actually my fave song on release day, so fun. Love the booty bass, more pop stars need to reheat this sound

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Cunted up Sweet but Psycho

**DaHumanTorch** (10): banana all in that split

**FakeMonaLisa28** (10): I swear the beginning of this song samples Hit 'Em Up Style by Blu Cantrell…

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is what Tate McRae thinks she sounds like btw

**kauai6** (10): a bop

**modulum83** (10): YES FEATURES YES SWEDISH SONGWRITERS YES TRAP BEATS 0% PURE UNCUT ROCK

**nooodisaster** (10): The song that actually starts the album! ""I won't give a fk about you"" is such an iconic first lyric.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i hated this on first listen bc the melody in the chorus really grated on me. then it ended up being one of my faves on the album it's just so catchy and melodic

**welcome2thejam** (10): That's just some good ass pop&b

**WesternWind** (10): don’t embarrass her motherf*cker or else..

**curryraejepsen** (9.8): idgaf this is one of her best like it's so much fun

**akanewasright** (9): looove this sound on her so much

**asadprofessorplum** (9): A diet of pure hatred does a body good.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i’m sorry regina george sabrina is the best sabrina

**stealthamo** (9): Still trying to figure out what TRL-era song that guitar reminds me of.

**Stryxen** (9): the fact that jesus really was a carpenter

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): sabrina is so absurdly good at being a pop star its insane

**innuendo\_overdose** (8.9): the production on this one is great, my longstanding love for pieces of chopped up vocals is being served by that opening

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): oh heavens above... oh neptune... oh nelly...

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended Gracie

**wathombe** (8.5): cute little bop

**ConnerY2323** (8.4): i’m generally unclear what the signature sabrina sound is but i would be ok if she gave us more of this

**Broshi** (8): ""Doesn't it sound like a Magdalena Bay song""

**FitzMarble** (8): if this were a worse album, this would’ve been the hit, but the album was blessed with many better songs instead thank carpenter

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): welcome back singulars act 1 and 2! but fr the way she says ""baby you say you really like it being mine/so let me give you some advice"" scratches my brain so delightfully

**Restless\_Dill16** (8): RIP Regina George. This would've been your theme song.

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): “Good Female Love Interest Turns Evil” Core

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7.5): Straightforward bop. Demands to be boogied along with. This always gets paired with Aries when people do song association with the zodiac, and as an Aries, I say damn right.

**darj** (7.5): this reminds me vaguely of Fergie - Glamorous

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.2): this feels like something out of 2017

**donewithbirds** (7): idk why the production on this doesn't quiiiteeee hit for me but oh well. catchy tune.

**implasdad** (7): its ok, fairly upbeat, im not slayed by it

**jman457** (7): like how the verses give off an early 00’s R&B vibe, but the chorus is kind of boring

**oh\_crow** (7): this is so breezy and fun!

**pig-serpent** (7): I'll forget that this song exists by the time the reveal happens but I'll enjoy hearing it in the queup.

**blueberries929** (6.7): Wait so will she give a fuck about you or not I couldn't tell

**ktajlili** (6.5): I find the production kind of mid, but I always enjoy it when this comes on. It's so catchy! So 6.5 it is.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I too still listen to My Boo by Ghosttown DJs

# **Bad graces**

**daftsone** (6): Me, personally, did not give too much of a fuck about this song

**human\_performance** (6): it's a fine song but nothing really pops here to elevate it

**vayyiqra** (6): Really I just like the sing-talking part, I have a thing for that in pop songs. The rest is eh, okay.

**runaway3212** (5): god please switch it up

**sfouou** (4.8): the worse of the two ""switch it up"" songs

**Able-Scene6741** (4.5): sorry it’s annoying for me

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4): easily digestible with usual pop beat structure

**fair-profile-8367** (3.5): LOVE the chorus but find the rest just kinda there...

**beeozan** (2.6): it is like Crystal Kay - Boyfriend Part II if it was incomplete. where was the QC check

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (2): something about the production/instrumental feels more like draft to me. But also I think coming right after a better written and composed song about the same topic that you threatening the guy you’re with not do anything that would upset you brings it down. Especially because if anything it’s more repetitive",4,2025-04-12 20:47:00

The hook is so catchy, and it contains some of Sabrina’s best lyrics. Definitely a grower imo! I’m super shocked this is going Day 2 honestly but what can we do…

**impla77** (8.3): Honestly this relationship was absolute cinema and we were all privileged to be able to witness it. I like this song, it’s a catchy, tongue in cheek bop but surely you already know the relationship is doomed to fail if you’re writing a song like this lol. The Dolly version… well if those two lovely ladies had a good time recording it I guess it was worth it, just not to the listening audience.

**camerinian** (8): “this song is vital to the sabrina canon in showing her range and establishing her humour as core to her personality, and it has been done a disrespect by not making it to day 3” i will say confidently, knowing my score is almost bang on where the average ended up

# **Barry Keoghan defenders**

**babadork** (11): Not coming up with “don’t make me hate you prolifically” first keeps Taylor Swift up at night

**goodbyesindisguise** (11): this song is literally flawless

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I never thought the following words could come out of my mouth, but Dolly ruined this song

**NervousLemon6670** (11): Barry Keoghan had to go into witness protection as Ringo Starr after this one

**1998tweety** (10): oh she HATES that man

**Ambrosia42** (10): i kinda hated this song at first and then i realized it was amazing idk. I can unfortunately relate to (previously) having a boyfriend who was always embarrassing me

**Broshi** (10): ""It got overplayed a little but still a 10""

**daftsone** (10): Please Please Please let this rate highly

**darj** (10): ready to announce this as the best production work Jack Antonoff has ever done. When I first heard it I thought “oh this is Dolly Parton meets late-period ABBA”— but he said in an interview he was inspired by ELO which, very obvious to me now.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I still don’t understand when she says “and everyone rolls their eyes”, is that everyone in the room or is she trying to pass it off as something that everyone from Ireland wherever this dude is from does?

**emayzee** (10): dreamiest most gorgeous song of 2024

**FluffyNobody** (10): the way she sings ""don't embarrass me motherfucker"" makes the whole song for me

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I hated this before but it did eventually grow on me

**jirachi** (10): i’d jack him off just for this alone idk

**ktajlili** (10): ""Please Please Please"" another strong hit, highlights Sabrina's wry sense of humor. Her sharp, precise lyrism captures the exasperation of dating someone who constantly toes the line of public humiliation. Without detailing what exactly makes him a mess, Sabrina makes you feel exactly what it’s like to be the one apologizing for him — again.

**Lynflower680** (10): Mothertrucker

**pbk** (10): honestly? might be the best single if u catch me on the right day

**RainbowSherbet47** (10): motherfucker 🤠

**Standard-Ad-7249** (10): best pre-release single on the album

**TiltControls** (10): pleek

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I love a lil double clap in a chorus I can clap along with thank you Ms Carpenter you understand my needs

**UselessTacooo** (10): after this year Jack gets another yearlong pass to make whatever trash he wants

**wathombe** (10): smart, funny, and of course i love the country vibe

**welcome2thejam** (10): Chorus instrumental is the special sauce

**curryraejepsen** (9.5): confession - i hated this song at first and idk why cause it's actually so good i wanna go back and slap some sense into myself

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): pretty pretty pretty

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.1): As an Irish person can I just say for the record that embarrassing Sabrina Carpenter actually is a really important part of our culture. It’s a national sport.

**Awkward\_King** (9): amazing amazing song about not wanting to be embarassed by a man how intensely relatable. a great song that plays with and utilises the public's knowledge of sabrina's private life and its so cheeky. the ceiling fan line is also one of my favs on the album

**Brilliant-Primary500** (9): this is a pretty good song, but HE did prove her right and now it's a sadder song than usual.

**buildingigloos** (9): I love the intro, it's like it should be soundtracking the start of a 2000s chick flick. And then the rest of the song would be used for a breakup revenge montage

**FitzMarble** (9): honestly the song is only like an 7 but the video is so iconic it really elevates the listening experience after seeing it

**Frajer** (9): he's sart of like an embarrassing morderforker

**jonathanadr13** (9): the key change in the second verse cured me

**runaway3212** (9): me dating literally anybody ever

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): immediate love but didn't age amazingly

**ricki** (8.8): she casted barry in her music video, i think it’s only fair he helps her get cast as yoko ono

**implasdad** (8.7): one of the better tracks off the album (implas note: at this point he had only listened to the singles)

**Able-Scene6741** (8.5): and he proved her right

**akanewasright** (8.5): very glad this was single 2. It showed another dimension to get while making

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8.5): she wrote this about the philadelphia phillies actually

**blueberries929** (8.4): MORE KEY CHANGES IN POP MUSIC PLEASE

**wane them lietoc!** (8.2): truly WHY does she say it like that? i mean I feel lke I know the answer but really, I'm asking on a metaphysical level how she does it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is overhated generally but also it’s 100% the worst single so I can’t complain too much when it goes out day 2.

**bogo** (8): i’m not gonna lie the ceiling fan IS so nice

**donewithbirds** (8): the ceiling fan bit is my favorite joke in a sabrina song she's so FUNNNYYYY

**skylofte2** (8): i liked this song and then got sick of it and now i like it again

**static\_int\_husp** (8): that ""motherfucker"" still leaves me in awe

**Straight-Meaning** (8): a grower but very good

**vayyiqra** (8): Headcanon there's Daft Punk influence in the synth arpeggios (looking up who produced it: lol Șerban Ghenea and Jack Antonoff). Instrumentally it's a lot more interesting than the lyrics. That's why I gave it a high score.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I think hearing the ceiling fan line for the first time is the exact moment I started to take Sabrina seriously

**dys-fx-al** (7.8): I've heard this song too many times now but I still kind of love it

**jman457** (7.8): fun little cheeky lyrics, but wish it was a bit punchier.

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (7.7): I love the way she sings motherfucker lmao

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): “Jack, hit the fucking arpeggiator because I’ve got a hit to write”

**Soalai** (7.5): It's good but IDK, I always feels like it's missing something or needs a bigger climax

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): she saw all those red flags and STILL entered a relationship with him??? straight women really are helpless",3,2025-04-12 20:47:46

**camerinian** (9.5): this only loses the .5 for me from lack of replay value, because otherwise holy shit!! This is such a striking, gut-wrenching way to open the album and it sets the tone perfectly. Every line is detailed and yet maximally resonant in that way Billie and Finneas seem so finely tuned to, and Billie’s runs through such a wide span of her vocal register right off the bat?? I just don’t really know how you could dislike this unless you were actively trying to tune the lyrics out.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): ROBBED BAD my god why is this 27th?? Everything about this song is so beautiful? Billie at her most vulnerable? Gorgeous vocals? These STRINGS? Like whenever I hear these strings I get an eargasm! Y’all need to be for real with this placement!

**impla77** (7.8): awe I really like this one and was hoping it would go a bit further, but alas, it is a ballad after all. This delicate opener is wispy and intangible in a way I really appreciate, and I love this vulnerable, personal side of Billie as the introduction to the album. Plus I love strings so the outro is delicious to me.

—

# **Fell in love for the first time**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It was a frankly preposterous choice to put LUNCH right after this gorgeous, vulnerable opening track. I support it so much.

**daftsone** (10): She ate though

**donewithbirds** (10): AND THE OLD ME IS STILL ME (AND MAYBE THE REAL ME) AND I THINK SHE'S PRETTY!!!! THE INTERNET IS HUNGRY FOR THE MEANEST KIND OF FUNNY AND SOMEBODY'S GOTTA FEED IT!!!! devastating, knocked my on my ass first listen.

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): lyric focused ballad? bitch I’m listening to the guitar I ain’t got time for no fcking words

**RandomHypnotica** (10): billie's gorgeous breathy vocals over a gorgeous acoustic guitar with lush pads in the background is truly all I need to be satisfied

**Standard-Ad-7249** (10): one of the strongest intro tracks out there

**Straight-Meaning** (10): I love this intro, it feels like what I love about her songwriting in one song.

**TiltControls** (10): Grew on me quite a bit - really works perfectly as an opener and ended up being one of my faves on the album

**emayzee** (9.5): her voice + the guitar are too gorg on this

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): Mariah Carey when:

**arboresca** (9): oh this breaks my heart. the strings at the end, the lyrics, wow. Billie is the master of the sad song

**buildingigloos** (9): Works really well for an opener, love the outro and how it lays the foundation for the Greatest

**CrimsonROSET** (9): girl dont worry i am skinny and sad as fuck

**dreamingpastel** (9): Billie always has great album openers. (Yes, this includes the one where it's just her taking off her Invisalign)

**dys-fx-al** (9): songs calling out the media + double standards will always get me

**jirachi** (9): i guess no main pop girl has been cunty enough to name a song “FAT” yet…

**nooodisaster** (9): put me in the Mariah Carey section

**1998tweety** (8.5): cant relate

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8.5): THE STRINGS ON THIS TRACK... BURY ME IN IT. This song is so insanely gorgeous it's crazy. The fact that it's not my favorite song even while being so beautiful is a testament to the album as a whole. Also suits the album artwork really well -- it does feel like submerging under the ocean and sinking deeper and deeper down into the world of the album...

**modulum83** (8.5): very similar setup to ""getting older"" off her last album, and there's still some of that haunted introspective feeling, but it feels just a bit less urgent and biting here in comparison

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): The best sequel to “Getting Older” that I can think of. I’m probably voting this as Miss Songeniality given the rest of y’all will treat this horribly.

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.5): Love it but also I’m always just sorta waiting for it to end so we can get to those haunting closing strings

**ConnerY2323** (8.3): love her in ethereal mode

**implasdad** (8.2): very melodical and wispy

**nonchalantthoughts** (8): oh Billie is really cutting deep here - 23 is such a hard year to experience

**vayyiqra** (8): [Can't stress enough that ""mean"" does not = ""funny""] ah damn the strings at the end are pretty

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Her songs are just so pretty to listen to

**wathombe** (8): very pretty, and the orchestral outro is straight-up gorgeous, but this one just isn't as catchy as the other tracks on the album

**welcome2thejam** (8): She's a dawg in a dawg pound

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): these lyrics are great and her vocal performance too, I wish there was a bit more

**Able-Scene6741** (7.5): first two songs being called skinny & lunch got me worried that Billie had an ED thankfully not but that made this song underwhelming lyrically

**FluffyNobody** (7.5): I love the strings at the end, but the chorus is a bit wonky

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7.5): those ending strings give ""purple summer"" from spring awakening vibes

**wane them lietoc!** (7.4): relistens make me think this is way too close to accidental soccer mommy

**jman457** (7.3): It was alright but its a beautiful outro that calls for The Greatest

**asadprofessorplum** (7): Orchestra tea

**beeozan** (7): shes the only one that has #balladrights in this rate according to the constitution i wrote

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7): relatable if it weren't for the fact that I'm fat, ugly, forgotten, delusional and sedentary at the same time.

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): almost entirely about the first verse: It is insane seeing how people treat you when you’re underweight because people literally treat you worse when you’re no longer underweight even doctors bc of the obsession society has being skinny. It’s honestly intolerable dealing with other peoples obsession with your body. I do Love the strings and i think the dog in a dog pound line isn’t clever but I do think starting with it about weight to transition to how hungry the internet is as go to a song about eating someone out is.

**oh\_crow** (7): it can be really hard to criticise a song that tackles a very heavy and personal topic, i will say her voice sounds lovely and the production is great. for me this songs meanders a little even for its comparatively short run time and isn't a standout on this album.

**qazz23** (7): slow opener but liked the strings at the end

**ricki** (7): the “so you think im skinnyyyyyy” tiktok sound but in a minor key

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): Legend

**WesternWind** (7): no wonder her opening is called skinny, she went all out for the instrumental and lyrics but not mixing",3,2025-04-12 19:20:50

**impla77** (8.4): the balladphobia continues and unfortunately its for a song i absolutely love. I wish this song didn’t hit as hard as it does for me because I haven’t been a teenager in a fewww years at this point but man that outro gets me everytime. I am such a sucker for a repetitive build up!! This is obviously the closer for the GUTS (unspilled) and I think it succeeds absolutely! Definitely wished this one went a bit further like… people say that it gets better… but what if i don’t???

**camerinian** (8): relistening to this to remind myself what i saw in it to give out an 8, and then the outro hits and i’m wondering why I didn’t go any higher than an 8. Sweet jesus what a way to close the album (normally)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): Oh Fadty don’t get ended severely like that… This is such a sad song, and the breakdown in the outro may be the best 30 seconds in the rate! Great closer of the deluxe album and dare I say a little robbed?

---

# **Teenager**


**CrimsonROSET** (11): as someone who has been pushed way too many times for aiming for more and not being allowed to settle for ‘good enough’, this was kinda cathartic for me. ‘No one has everything figured out’ isn't exactly great advice, but it’s not great advice I needed to hear.

**uiscebeathaoir** (11): That outro. That fucking outro. That motherfucking outro. Espresso put up a hard, brutal fight for my 11 but in the end it was that one goddamned motherfucking outro

**Able-Scene6741** (10): it won’t get better sorry girl 😔

**curryraejepsen** (10): soooooo good the breakdown is amazing

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): Olivia Smells Like Teen Dreams (is this anything?)

**Lynflower680** (10): Can’t wait for the FART album

**runaway3212** (10): This song really makes me feel like I'm growing up with olivia cause I so relate to this song

**Straight-Meaning** (10): I love this song another one I could’ve given my top score to.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): feels like a classic olivia song and screaming out that bridge is super cathartic

**donewithbirds** (9): should not relate as hard to this as a fully grown 27 year old but i sure do!!! someday the bridge won't hit me like a truck but not today!!!

**fair-profile-8367** (9): As a kid who forced herself to grow up insanely quickly, this song kills me every time

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (9): unfortunately I regret to inform miss rodrigo that that life does not get any better

**team\_kockroach** (9): I think this was the final song I listened to in 2023, which is funny because I wasn’t even remotely close to a teenager that year. But goddamn Olivia pulled out all the stops with this one.

**wathombe** (9): seems to be another pretty and slightly forgettable ballad until the drop hits

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8.8): A perfect ending track. I love the way it builds (I am a sucker for this gimmick, see ""THE GREATEST"" and my love for ""Happier Than Ever""). Also it always clocks me to remember she was 19 when she wrote this album. NINETEEN???? A FETUS?

**modulum83** (8.7): emo is so back

**Frajer** (8.5): she found her fucking teenage dream

**Stryxen** (8.5): and when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

**TiltControls** (8.5): It's a little clunky at parts, but overall the song works well

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a good closer but remember how robbed hope ur ok was? I’m still a bit peeved.

**daftsone** (8): I can confirm that things don’t necessarily get better

**slimboyfriend** (8): props to her for making a song about making a sophomore album actually relatable to a normal person

**Ambrosia42** (7.6): okk wait the lyrics started to grow on me and then it picked up

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): why is this kinda the most devastating song ive ever heard…like yeah i do feel like i already had my best life at 19 and its only going to get worse why am i doomposting over an olivia rodrigo song

**wane them lietoc!** (7.2): kinda could use a jack white guitar

**dys-fx-al** (7.1): the depth

**Baelyana** (7): yeah it's a cute ending

**blueberries929** (7): Blaine Anderson who?

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7): ""Can you make Happier Than Ever? Of course, I could, let me show you how!""

**emayzee** (7): listening to this like ""19 is a child what is her dramatic ass crying about"" as if i didn't sob in bed staring at my walls to lorde's ribs when i turned 20 years old

**jirachi** (7): where's that picture of that twitter gay recreating the sour album cover

**nonchalantthoughts** (7): olivia, your 20s are worse!

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): Hearing this when I was 19 was crazy

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I was scared at the beginning but THANK YOU Olivia for actually ending your album on an epic note and not quietly like some people

**WesternWind** (7): she’s still looking for that fucking teenage dream huh

# **Madonna**


**asadprofessorplum** (6.8): “It gets better” is a psyop.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): a pop girlie can NOT release a song with this title only for it to be this whelming

**ConnerY2323** (6.7): the ending raises the score a bit because this is a slog until then

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): even if i dont think its perfect i do like what this song tries to do and the note it ends the album on

**nooodisaster** (6.5): as a 9 year old, girl 19 is SO YOUNG.

**oh\_crow** (6.5): ok i was so ready to rate this low but i enjoyed where it went. you got me this time rodrigo but i'm wise to you now

**bigbigbee** (6): Cute but paradoxically feels a bit juvenile (the writing feels more Sour than Guts)

**krusso1105** (6): Some of the weaker songs get lower scores than they would otherwise because everything around them is so strong

**vayyiqra** (6): Well ,,, it kinds of does. Sometimes.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): I need this trend of boring songs exploding in the second half to be over already, not everybody can pull off a Happier Than Ever.

**FluffyNobody** (5): nothing new outsold

**IIIHenryIII** (5): it takes too long to build

**pig-serpent** (5): It was really cool when I saw her live and she had a long preamble on this song, explaining how she was feeling depressed on her 19th birthday and talked about overcoming her fear of growing older and that she managed to actually enjoy her 21st birthday and is now excited to grow old. It was a powerful and touching story that lead to me enjoying this song for the first, and likely, last time in my life.

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (4): objectively good ballad I just don’t care for ballads

**letsallpoo** (4): this is like when former gifted students complain about being average adults

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4): another sour facsimile but worse

**camerinian** (8): always love a song that expresses exhaustion like this, and double points for it being self-inflicted, like that shit can’t help but hit in the gut. Also shoutout to the chiptune-y synth in the background and the fuzz guitar on the bridge, I see u Dan, good shit cos this could have been such a boring production otherwise

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): This noise rock ballad serve… Olivia serves up another devastating ballad on this cut, and clearly y’all resonated with it! It’s definitely on the higher echelon in GUTS and I’m glad it survived the ballad massacre of Day 2.

**impla77** (7.9): Damn looking back now I should’ve just given every Olivia song a 10 except GIRL I’VE ALWAYS BEEN I STILL HATE THAT ONE. This is another introspective ballad with such gut wrenching lyrics I can’t help but relate. I love the guitar on this one and the general vibe but it did always seem a song that was destined for day 2.

# **Taylor Swift - Clean**

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): I’VE MADE MY BED I’LL LIE IN IT!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): BALLADPHOBIA BE GONE FROM THIS HOUSE

**bogo** (10): if i ever end up relating too hard to this song just put me out of my misery

**daftsone** (10): How is Olivia so young and yet able to make a song as brilliant as this

**FitzMarble** (10): deep breaths.. ooooh my god this SONG

**jirachi** (10): okay diva you get a 10 too

**modulum83** (10): knee deep in the passenger seat and you're making the bed is it casual now

**pbk** (10): every word of this is like a knife to the chest she just gets it man

**runaway3212** (10): Like omfg her pen was on fire

**Standard-Ad-7249** (10): easily one of her best ballads

**Straight-Meaning** (10): she was in her lorde bag and I am here for it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): SHOULDVE BEEN A SINGLE!!!

**FakeMonaLisa28** (9.6): “They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction” ‎sobs

**Able-Scene6741** (9.5): I cried ngl

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): the hotel cleaning staff:

**asadprofessorplum** (9): Keep this girl behind the wheel like a long haul trucker. That’s where her best music comes from.

**darj** (9): sweeping and grand

**kauai6** (9): now this is what i’m talking about

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): This song sounds like drowning in a sea of duvets

**Baelyana** (8.7): grew on me a ton

**ricki** (8.5): making the bed in the morning in indeed hard enough to write a sad ass song like this one

**wane them lietoc!** (8.3): just fucks my shit up when she does the anthemic christian rock power ballad

**blueberries929** (8): fucking heartbreaking

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): great song, but not relatable for me

**CrimsonROSET** (8): they’re gonna hate on this but these ballads show her range!!!

**donewithbirds** (8): best ballad on the album! putting the work to get something you want so badly and then being unsatisfied when you reach it and having to acknowledge that you did this to yourself... rough.

**FluffyNobody** (8): I forgot how much I actually like this

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): a better lyrical use of a cliche than in ""vampire""

**jman457** (8): See olivia this is how you write a good Ballad

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): That second verse is darker than I remembered

**skylofte2** (8): this melody ugh her mind

**Soalai** (8): This is her version of The Archer, so raw and honest

**WesternWind** (8): me when I wake up in the morning

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.8): real

**Frajer** (7.5): canceled for using single use plastic

**hikk** (7.5): distorted guitar

**oh\_crow** (7.5): why was i so ready to hate on ballads on this thing they've gone off a bit so far. eh i'll find one to hate on later on

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): me every morning as part of my routine

**wathombe** (7.5): a couple of pretty, if unmemorable, ballads in the middle of the tracklist here

**Ambrosia42** (7.3): I guess it sounds like she made her bed so she’s got to lie in it

**UselessTacooo** (7.3): couldn’t be me

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**buildingigloos** (7): I kinda wish this was a double album of slow piano songs and the upbeat pop rock. it's just a bit jarring going from upbeat to ballad back to upbeat back to ballad, and it doesn't feel like the track listing has been deliberately chosen in this order, it just feels like a playlist. That said, it's still a pretty good song

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): the start is very slow but I do really like it when it gets going

**IIIHenryIII** (7): she’s just like us, making our beds every morning

**ktajlili** (7): Making the bed is often the song that I forget about, but when I listen to the full album, I remember how much I enjoy it. It sounds a little too similar to other songs on the album.

**Stryxen** (7): i hate to be the guy that critiques slow songs for being slow but i feel like some more energetic drumming in places would really tie this together

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is what all the new black country new road songs sound like to me

**team\_kockroach** (7): I criticized Lacy for a lot of characteristics that also appear on their song, but I think Making the Bed mostly knocks it out of the park. The pre-chorus grew on me with every listen.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Conan HELP she's starting to sing mid ballads again you need to stop her

**camerinian** (9.5): her 2010s indie pop rock slay ughhhhh this is directly targeted at the big glowing red spot on my back labelled “guy who’ll never admit out loud he’s a 1975 fan”

**impla77** (6.8): I’ll be honest this overstayed its welcome for me. I just don’t really relate to this one as much so it doesn’t hit as hard. I like the instrumental but the chorus is kinda meh and its one of the weaker tracks on the album in my opinion.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.3): why in the world was this nearly day 3? it’s a pretty generic message song and i have heard this message delivered better somewhere else. definitely overrated imo.

# **Enjoys fast fashion**

**Able-Scene6741** (11): and this is how Olivia GODrigo will destroy the fast fashion and beauty industries

**Baelyana** (11): the beachy guitar. the dynamic vocals. the godly melody writing thank you amy allen olivia and dan

**dys-fx-al** (11): this goes into my s tier songs playlist. i could never get tired of listening to her <3

**no\_dau\_lt** (11): am I doing this rate just to give this song an 11? yeah kind of

**asadprofessorplum** (10): I’ve never been too good for a body dysmorphia anthem.

**bespectacIed** (10): so funny when rich popular pretty girls sing about experiencing any type of dysphoria. My culture is not your costume

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): If the people with good taste unionize we can get this to Day 3.

**bogo** (10): wait a minute is this shoegaze

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): very relatable for someone like me, who tried to make himself look presentable but like, everytime I looked at the mirror, I'm being reminded that I look like a Picasso mistake gone wrong.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): but do pretty girls make graves?

**human\_performance** (10): This got an 8 just on the guitar tone, and she conveys the emotion of the song so well here

**qazz23** (10): this almost has a post-punk sound to it based on that guitar tone

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wake up, be hypnotica, loop song about feeling ugly and unlovable because it is too extremely real captured in 4K ultra high def, cry a LOT

**runaway3212** (10): Impla's dad compared this to The Cure and I see the vision cause this is fucking amazing

**skylofte2** (10): ended western beauty standards

**Stryxen** (10): this really makes me cry you guys i can’t do this rn jhrhjhgf

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i love jealousy jealousy and this somehow happens to be even better

**TiltControls** (10): this is pretty

**UselessTacooo** (10): RAHHHHHHHHHHHH

**wathombe** (10): heartbreaking and incredibly effective

**welcome2thejam** (10): Indie pop rock superstar Olivia Rodrigo does it again

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.6): stroke of genius with album sequencing, this gives such heavy penultimate vibes. The instrumental is soooo beautiful.

**hikk** (9.5): her skipping lunch omg the billie shade

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): listens to Souvlaki once

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.5): I just think it’s neat

**NervousLemon6670** (9.3): At this point of the rate I was desperate for a song not about heartbreak / a boy fucking her over so for this to hit? And actually be good? Miss Rodrigo I was not familiar with your game

**darj** (9): this is like if Katy didn’t completely fall on her ass with 123abc album or whatever is actually returned to One of The Boys. and this is on an album that has a song literally called “Teenage Dream”

**donewithbirds** (9): went to the guts tour with my bestie and their little sister and she went fucking NUTS for this one. love when a song about teenage girl insecurities is like. good. and she's right!!!! it'll never be enough!!!!

**Frajer** (9): so sad that pretty much every young woman suffers from body image issues

**Restless\_Dill16** (9): Even as a guy in his mid-twenties who has also struggled with body image, this song really struck a chord with me.

**seanderlust** (9): this is how you do a 90s alt-pop-rock vamp

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Olivia is like the queen of adolescent girl power music I swear

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (8.8): the guitar on this song really adds to the emotion of the whole thing

**ricki** (8.8): damn so if not olivia feels pretty i might as well kill myself, it’s over for the rest of us (message sent by someone that took the wrong message from this song)

**Ambrosia42** (8.6): this indie rock queen

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): ""stopped eating cake on birthdays"" ouuuu i felt the little bit of bulimia left in my brain smirk

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.5): man i relate to this so hard

**implasdad** (8.3): i’m loving the cure feel to this song

**jman457** (8.3): The lyrics are a little on the nose, but the cure throwback is so good, ill allow it.

**curryraejepsen** (8.2): a bit overrated by fans mayhaps but i still love this one

**arboresca** (8): adore the production & sonics of this whole song, and the lyrics are really real & honest. I don't know why I even try either, Olivia.

**buildingigloos** (8): I feel like I'm 5 years too old for this album, because this was me when I was 21. Also, it's kinda like that scene in the Barbie movie where Margot Robbie is crying about societal pressures on women to be beautiful and the voice over is like maybe Margot Robbie wasn't the best actress for these lines. Because Olivia Rodrigo is gorgeous, like unhumanly gorgeous

**flava** (8): it’s a bit abrupt and melodically underdeveloped, but it’s still good

**IIIHenryIII** (8): neither is ugly

**ImADudeDuh** (8): close enough, welcome back tlc - unpretty

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): End the beauty standards again for me queen

**team\_kockroach** (8): This feels as self-reflective and quietly feminist as SZA’s best works. Fuck, I’m so impressed with how Olivia and Dan put this together. I’m not too fond of the chorus but everything else is fantastic.

**vayyiqra** (8): She's so right. Never forget ! the internet is not real !

**WesternWind** (8): i stopped eating cake on birthdays bc eggs are too expensive

**wane them lietoc!** (7.6): this is just a soccer mommy song

**bigbigbee** (7.5): beginning of this always makes me want to go listen to Better Oblivion Community Center - Dylan Thomas. I like when she leans into the slightly more indie pop rock sound, so I like this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): love the 90’s vibes here

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7.5): why isn't this the song they use for her lancome ads (it's perfume this joke doesn't even WORK) uhh it's like if ""believe in me"" by demi lovato was depressed

**kauai6** (7.3): good melody

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is the perfect recipe to work for me and it doesnt i dont get it i blame mac cosmetics

**daftsone** (7): If Olivia Rodrigo isn’t pretty, I don’t even want to think what that makes me

**jirachi** (7): me when i have to reach the word limit on an essay:

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): Sorry why are we complaining about HTE nachos, I thought y’all liked that one? If the nachos are this good I will take 5 more portions! The buildup in this song is godly, and it’s the one moment in the album when Billie really SINGS. A great song that didn’t quite deserve the flak that it got!

**impla77** (8.2): I will always love a melodramatic, orchestral number with a slow, deliberate build up so I was always going to like this one. However its hard to not compare to its rate winner sister, Happier Than Ever and that’s a song I like a lot more in terms of its endpoint. I still think this is a very solid track and successful at what its going for and I guess that’s good enough for me on the whole!

**camerinian** (6): i’ll always be in favour of those big sweeping arena rock buildups and this one certainly hits, but I just fear the less distinct lyrics in the leadup do not give it the sort of catharsis it yearns for. Good attempt to juice the track up but it doesn’t get all the way

---

# **THE GREATEST**


**ambitiousbulbasaur** (10): Aptly named track, because goddamn this song is so good. Perfect build. I lack the articulation to speak more on it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t care if Billie’s made this song before. I will take five more.

**buildingigloos** (10): Its like a gut punch. I listen and I’m immediately upset. Feeling like no matter what you do you’re never going to be enough for them,

**CrimsonROSET** (10): and if i say this outsold happier than ever

**daftsone** (10): The crescendo of this song gets me every time, you can really feel the pain

**donewithbirds** (10): ""all the times i waited/for you to want me naked"" billie just give me the word and i'll make it look like an accident

**flava** (10): I know I’m gonna get blasted by the hosts and probably everyone but this is everything I wanted from Happier Than Ever (song) that I never got there. And while it doesn’t quite there on a cathartic level, musically it is just blowing, the guitars are mixed so much better, and the build up to it is just presented so much better waiting especially when it parallels the song, waiting for appreciation and passion to be returned and then just blowing the fuck up when that doesn’t happen before dumping the guy

**goodbyesindisguise** (10): the build… the lyric change ups… the insane vocals… this is her magic

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): pointless. there’s no point to making another singer-songwriter dynamic build, this song is conceptually unworthy BUT it just sounds great.

**nooodisaster** (10): bitch let me cry.

**curryraejepsen** (9.8): oh happier than ever don't make that face

**stealthamo** (9.7): Billie Eilish is so unbelievably good at making me feel things.

**Able-Scene6741** (9.5): pls make a music video for this one Billie

**wathombe** (9.5): i really really love the drop and the big orchestral finish in this track

**UselessTacooo** (9.4): sittin on his lap sipping diet HTE

**NervousLemon6670** (9.1): Its not gonna win but I guess it can be the greatest of Day 2 or something hopefully

**asadprofessorplum** (9): Ooh don’t set yourself up like this.

**bogo** (9): sure i’ll take happier than ever 2.0

**dys-fx-al** (9): i relate a little too hard to this

**jirachi** (9): she accidentally entered the demi lovato singing class instead of the selena gomez one omg

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i adore double-barrel Billie songs

**TiltControls** (9): I wish the front half was a little more interesting cause that back part is an 11. Not that it needed to go right into the climax, but she's done similar switchups in the past (HTE) with much stronger front halves

**arboresca** (8.5): her belts give me life and the buildup is so good, plus this one's another sad one

**blueberries929** (8.5): This is the centerpiece of the album, she deserves so much more love!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love it when she uses her full vocal range

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.5): An incredible, jaw-dropping dynamic build paired with disappointingly vague lyrics. Billie’s songwriting thrives when it has specificity and a clear concept and this just doesn’t deliver that

**Baelyana** (8.4): SIIIIIIIING billie

**ConnerY2323** (8.1): everyone’s gonna call this reheated nachos and my response is well at least she used the air fryer

**Frajer** (8): her and Phoebe are passing around the same plate of nachos

**jman457** (8): Doesnt hit as hard HTE title track, but I love hearing her vocals soar on a rock track

**seanderlust** (8): it's great, but it kind of feels like she was going for the raw, dramatic build of HTE but tbh HTE felt more raw and honest. still love this one though

**1998tweety** (7.5): did not end Lana

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7.5): she's reheating her Happier Than Ever nachos and it still taste good to serve with a little bit of cunt and rockstar style.

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7.5): on 1st listen I wanted to stay in the rage from the bridge a little longer ala ""hte,"" but now I'm not as annoyed by it...but if I wanted to be annoying, I would say that they tried to reheat the ""hte"" nachos but messed up the recipe

**qazz23** (7.5): that crescendo was amazing but i can't say that it lived up to the title

**implasdad** (7.2): bit samey. not her best. its not as good as simply the best by tina turner.

**FitzMarble** (7): the buildup just does not do it for me

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the last part is unnecessary imo

**jackisboredtoday** (7): good but i kinda just wanna listen to happier than ever again instead during this one

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): Song on this album is the next one? yes!

**team\_kockroach** (7): I wish I could like minimalist Billie more but this one’s really a patience-tester until the halfway mark. I bet it kills live, but until then I’ll just listen to Happier Than Ever (title track) if I want vibes like these.

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): she was sick of being called a whisper singer",2,2025-04-12 19:45:18

**impla77** (9.3): Maybe I rated this a bit too highly but the first two minutes are so amazing that I wanted to automatically give it a 10! I think the second half of this track is so pretty as well but I just want the first part to go on a little longer tbh. Also I am forced to acknowledge the fuckass voice modulator part which pisses me off everytime because it is just entirely unnecessary and doesn’t add anything to the song. I think this is the weakest as a closer out of the three main albums and I’m just glad there wasn’t a surprise double album release that people thought was teased by the last line lol (do 2024 ult).

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): As a True Blue stan for a few years now, I’m glad Billie decided to release this eventually AND the rework is as great as it is. BLUE is pretty much the centerpiece of the album and the references of the previous songs on the album is masterful. Definitely a mesmerizing song that should have placed a bit higher!

**camerinian** (8.5): perhaps a smidge of the internalised balladphobia here from me holding this back from a 10, but this should have been the, ahem, blueprint for all the ballads here, like this has a very strong hook from the outset, leans on billie’s well-established strengths with the multi-tracking, and then when the changeup comes it adds to the investment in the lyrical narrative of this relationship disintegrating before her eyes. The payoffs work so well and it’s structurally incredibly sound in a way that stays engaging

# **Feeling so blue**

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (11): Gorgeous. Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. I love how this song flows seamlessly in from ""BITTERSUITE"" like waves lapping the shore; I love how we've arrived at ""BLUE,"" the deepest, darkest part of the ocean before it turns completely black and we drown. Yet we manage to come back to life and ascend back towards the surface before the worst happens, invoked by the tempo switch-up halfway through that literally feels like it's drifting upward towards the light. I can't even explain it. The production here is mesmerizing in the back half, and the lyrics are intriguing and mysterious and utterly evocative. A perfect album closer that takes all the best parts of the album and does everything right. The way it brings back the strings from SKINNY too, setting up an effortless loop to listen and submerge again... oh it's so fucking good. Billie, Finneas, take my endless streams, for its all I have to offer.

**Straight-Meaning** (11): I love this song, I think it is one of her best songs ever along with HTE. The second half with the bluer than a butterfly line gives me chills.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Wait a fucking minute. Why did I kick this album out of my AOTY top 10?? I love this album!

**Brilliant-Primary500** (10): this is a great closer for the album but I wish it came earlier.

**daftsone** (10): A perfect end to a perfect album

**donewithbirds** (10): oh god i love this one the first half frantically repeating lines from every song on the album, like a person anxiously scanning through memories to figure out what went wrong, where they could have fixed things. anD THEN the gorgeous, gorgeous second half that feels like empty, resigned acceptance. ""i don't blame you/but i can't change you/don't hate you/but we can't save you."" to realize that a person you love is broken for reasons that you can understand and empathize with, but cannot fix, and that it's time to let go. OOF. stunning album closer.

**dys-fx-al** (10): i just love the way she sounds on this one

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is a top 3 song on the album and the people who get it get it

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): the genius closer. it’s genius.

**nooodisaster** (10): The centerpiece of the album. And also it's finale. The way it's referenced throughout the album so when you finally hear the beat it feels somehow familiar? Study it.

**Standard-Ad-7249** (10): this track has been there for me during every breakdown i've had since 2024

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): an immediate highlight for me and a fantastic closer

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Why did this song literally only start hitting for me as I was sitting down to do the rate, took it long enough

**UselessTacooo** (10): the strings mimicking the greatest? kunt.

**krusso1105** (9.5): Why do I suspect this is going to get robbed because of longsongophobia (It's not that long but compared to most of the other songs in the rate it is)?

**beeozan** (9.4): the way there is a 10 stuck in between these last two songs in the album but its split into two

**modulum83** (9.3): ENDED joni mitchell ENDED weezer ENDED beyonce ENDED eiffel 65 ENDED the entire cast and crew of Bluey

**arboresca** (9): again with the parallels, I have so many thoughts. the different beats & styles are so interesting. also the last line! very thought provoking as a whole.

**Frajer** (9): it's new the shape of your body it's blue the feeling I've got

**jirachi** (9): me when i am in a naming ikea logo colors challenge and someone else said yellow already:

**Sad-Guidance9105** (9): The Ambiance…

**Stryxen** (9): this is literally the only song here where the crazy structuring works for me, however the random cheap trap drop right at probably the most important part of the song stops this being perfect

**Treecoh** (9): First part is so good but the second half drags

**Baelyana** (8.8): great start, kind of slow but apt finish to a good album

**Able-Scene6741** (8.5): weird choice for a closer but I respect it

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): Love how multiphased and creepy this is. Not a fan of the first minute, but the song really picks up after that.

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (8.4): this is one of my favorites from the album, it’s very well written and performed

**Ayzrules** (8.3): this is gorgeous- dark, lush, and atmospheric, with such a nice rhythm to boot. But i’m really not a fan of how billie has all these random drawn out interlude-esque sections in her songs??? It checks me the fuck out of the entire thing

**asadprofessorplum** (8): Blue like the colour of math school folders

**buildingigloos** (8): The first half is like a reprisal of the whole album, I looove when album closers do that, like what a catch by fall out boy or don't go outside by poppy.

**darj** (8): good closer I did like the production here

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): We love a Madonna reference.

**FitzMarble** (8): I vibe with this tbh

**vayyiqra** (8): Only learning now that Billie had the Marías open for her on tour and that lined up so perfectly didn't it. I mean having a mopey alt-pop album with an blue underwater theme. RIP my writeup on it I never finished whoops I would have wanted to see that but that wasn't in Toronto. Still, what timing.

**ConnerY2323** (7.6): loose but rewarding

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7.5): the first half outsold. I enjoyed all the callbacks but the pitched-down voice was a jumpscare

**blueberries929** (7.3): Almost a whole year later and I'm still asking what the last line was for, like...",2,2025-04-12 19:59:29

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): This is so effortlessly catchy, I’ve been singing the chorus to myself for the past 3 days now! Such an earworm.. Just a wonderful mindless bop, and I’m glad it got the love it deserves!

**camerinian** (8): sabrina’s vaguely threatening energy is so well balanced here, almost to a fault, like maybe it would have been better if she committed to either playing more coy or being more outright pissed with this dude, but it’s all a bop so who really cares

**impla77** (6.3): Yeah I’ve made it known that none of the Sabrina bonus cuts really tickled my fancy. I just find the lyrics quite obnoxious and the music itself pretty bland, though I do love the way she says bitch ass, that’s the highlight of the song for me. It just feels like we’re retreading ground that was done better on the main album here. Side note, I thought this was going to be the last bonus track standing for Sabrina but 15 Minutes, despite being about a short period of time, has outlasted this.

—

# **Have a lot on their plates**

**1998tweety** (10): the discourse is so annoying

**darj** (10): I DIDN’T WANT YOUR BITCH ASS ANYWAY. Again why is Sabrina kinda Kerry Butler coded sometimes lmao. Also kinda Olivia Newton John this would be in an update to Xanadu….wait, am I basically calling this a track from Zanna, Don’t…….

**FakeMonaLisa28** (10): why didn’t this get a music viiddeeeeoooooo

**IIIHenryIII** (10): BANGER

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): this is the other version of new wave, her Eurythmics to Olivia Rodrigo’s Blondie.

**ricki** (10): im so glad she released this i was tired of listening to this via spotify podcast

**runaway3212** (10): She's so mecoded sometimes I've moved all my plans for some random guy before but also if somebody rejects me I'm like ""... like I care... I have meetings to go to... you could not even think about being on my level""

**Standard-Ad-7249** (10): totally lived up to the hype

**UselessTacooo** (10): the best song on the album being a bonus track? Oh she really is taydaughter

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): We have The Giver at home:

**Able-Scene6741** (9): close enough, welcome back picture to burn 🥳

**bogo** (9): “i didn't want your little bitch ass anyway” for some reason has a tight grip on my psyche, like i just have the urge to scream the line out which is not a good urge to have in public

**buildingigloos** (9): The instrumental is giving me Chappell Roan style 80s revival. Also, I heard this song in the hairdressers the other day - music video when??

**CrimsonROSET** (9): if you stay busy you dont have to get busy!

**FluffyNobody** (9): the pause before calendar, I just love her

**Frajer** (9): she's a busy woman cuz she's a singer

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (9): this biological abbadaughter

**RainbowSherbet47** (9): Picture to Burn walked so Busy Woman could run

**WesternWind** (9): oh gobdrina make me your partner, although months later I might say I really don't need your love  

 no flopbarry, your little bitch ass is over

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): it's a bop!!

**Ambrosia42** (8.3): She sort of flips the script here, where guys are usually the one getting mad at rejection and telling women they were ugly anyway. Instead here, Saqueena is the one who might get rejected, and she doesn’t want to waste her time with someone who doesn’t recognize her worth. It’s a catchy song, but I think 15 Minutes should have been pushed from the deluxe instead!

**arboresca** (8): I know this was teased/a well known unreleased song but it's new to me & I'm kind of obsessed

**asadprofessorplum** (8): Is this the Woman’s World some have been singing about?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I so appreciate how silly her songwriting is, especially in these trying times.

**donewithbirds** (8): loooove the strings. sabrina release a disco album PLEEAASSEEE

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): I’m also a busy woman. Busy being emotionally unavailable!

**jirachi** (8): these verses are ass but i'm bopping idc

**kauai6** (8): nice chorus

**Lynflower680** (8): insert that one meme showing Taylor Swift singing the original version of Picture To Burn here

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I won trivia by knowing this song, so gonna pretend I like it more than I do

**wathombe** (8): doesn't gel quite as well as many of the other tracks on the album

**Soalai** (7.5): This one is fun

**blueberries929** (7.3): Might be Stockholm syndrome but I still prefer the low quality version I added using local files

**jman457** (7.2): Again it isnt sticking

**beeozan** (7): oh im hearing vocoders remind me to check the comments to see how many people mentioned daft pönk (hosts note: noone else i fear)

**daftsone** (7): The vocal effects on this track are pretty lush

**pig-serpent** (7): This is the most Short and Sweet song to Short and Sweet..

**vayyiqra** (7): Good instrumental, the lyrics are kind of :|

# **Procrastinators**

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (6.9): Time for my second unpopular opinion! I don't get the hype for this one either. Again, are y'all just really horny? Comfortably somewhere between a 6 or 7, but giving my decimal point as a 9 because I think Sabrina would appreciate that.

**sfouou** (6.9): id leave my clothes on until i get there, personally

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): sabrinabba

**fair-profile-8367** (6.5): I love the production, but I hate the ""Oh, Hey!""

**ConnerY2323** (6): listening to this album is a constant challenge not to scream WE GET IT every time she makes a new pun about cum

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): The chorus is great but the verses are so ass.

**dys-fx-al** (6): ok

**qazz23** (6): Busy Child outsold

**Sad-Guidance9105** (6): Bop but cringe

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): She basically summarized her whole aesthetic into one song. “I’m horny and wanna fuck. Oh you don't want to? Pussy.” I just wish it was written better

**pbk** (5): this one just does not hit for me even if it is on the boppier end

**stealthamo** (5): I could easily picture Meghan Trainor singing this. That is not a good thing.

**bespectacIed** (4): Nauseatingly overproduced

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3): somehow nothing happened in this song and the message forgotten

**krusso1105** (0): This isn't actually that bad, but with so many good songs in this rate it feels really weak by comparison",2,2025-04-12 20:06:25

**camerinian** (9): okay okay i get it billie has a very high standard to live up to with the multi-parters but jesus come on these parts are both excellent! yes it’s a jarring transition but it’s that exact contrast that helps both part stand out on their own, the gentle swing and croon of the first part crashing tactlessly into the rave-up of part 2 is super memorable, like there’s no attempt at all to smooth it out and that’s exciting! It helps push through the message of having to move on from the pain of a lost love! It’s a good idea ok finneas cooked!

**impla77** (7.1): I have to say I never really considered that the switch up is weird af, I kinda just went with it lmao. I like the first part a bit more though it does drag a bit AND I went on holiday with my ten year old cousin who kept singing the first line of this song over and over again so I have trauma from that. Maybe I should have got him to do the rate, the last I heard he was really vibing with the Sabrina album LOL. The second part is whatever, I don’t think it’s what Billie excels at and it shows. Overall a fun track but not something I return to all that often.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.7): I might be the only person who prefers the first part LMAO. I think it’s so lovely, like it could be played in a coffee shop! And I love chiller music, bossa nova is my favorite genre after all so… The second part could have done with a lot less autotune? vocoder? idk what the voice effects are but they’re very offputting that’s for sure.

# **Bonjour mademoiselle**

**1998tweety** (10): this was my immediate standout on first listen so she gets a 10

**Awkward\_King** (10): billie's voice here is unlike at any other point i've heard her sing i think it's her lower register but it just hits so good. this is 100% oxytocin's younger sister i hope billie follows further down the dancey route in her next album

**ConnerY2323** (10): can i give this a 20 since both songs are a 10

**CrimsonROSET** (10): BOMBOMBOM

**daftsone** (10): I’ll never get sick of that beat change

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): fun song and the production/instrumental is different from the other tracks that were starting bleed together. It talks about upsetting material while also being very tongue in cheek that keeps the pacing well. The end is really great and wonderful transition and fun switch up.

**implasdad** (10): got a bit of gotye flair to it.

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): is this jacking the shit of Damon “Gorilla” Albarn? I’d say so, and somehow my vote is worth the same as yours

**ktajlili** (10): God, I just realized that L'AMOUR DE MA VIE describes an experience I had with a long-forgotten ex. Not being able to return love is such a soul-crushing experience, but when you've been duped the entire time, all you can think is how they're such a motherfucker. Billie has such as interesting voice -- singing low and sultry in the beginning before belting at the end. The disco switch-up at the end is the chef's kiss of an incredible song.

**pig-serpent** (10): Giving the best slow song in the rate a beat switch into a great synth pop song. Oh, Godie, don't end them like that. Obviously the best song on the album but the best I can hope for is highest controversy apparently.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Imagine a whole Billie dance album? Oui s’il vous plaît!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the way this switch up changed me the first time i heard it

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): If Happier Than Ever was raised by wolves who loved hyperpop

**UselessTacooo** (10): writing this the day after Sex, Violence, Suicide went out day 1 in afropop…. This does not bode well for my girly

**curryraejepsen** (9.6): WAITTTT THE OUTROOOO

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9.5): I would prefer L'amour De Ma Vie and Over Now to be two seperate songs tbh, the switch-ups are getting too expected and I hope she stops doing them on her next album. The first part of the song is amazing though.

**Baelyana** (9.1): #realmusic

**modulum83** (9): this song is two queens maximizing their joint slay

**oh\_crow** (9): oh my godddd billie needs to keep making weirdo bangers like this

**runaway3212** (9): The second part omfgggg Billie was like a butterfly coming out of a boring af cocoon

**Sad-Guidance9105** (9): I WISH FRENCH PEOPLE WERE REAL

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): This song is set up for perfection, if only the second half was a bit longer and went a bit harder it could have reached it

**vayyiqra** (9): The intro was making me think of Laufey lol, and then it turned into an 80s synthpop banger, great switchup I forgot it did that

**blueberries929** (8.3): Couldn't listen to the album the day it dropped and still salty I got spoiled about the song's twist

**NervousLemon6670** (8.2): Miss Eilish this is clearly two songs you forgot to split up, pairing them together only makes them add up to less than the individual parts of the whole

**bespectacIed** (8): final lap was a production masterclass

**dys-fx-al** (8): the beat change goes so hard

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the switch up here

**RainbowSherbet47** (8): Bro the fucking synth towards the end threw me off. Not mad tho 🕺

**skylofte2** (8): now why is she in french

**WesternWind** (8): omg Billie is also a Taylor daughter for making her own version of loml

**FakeMonaLisa28** (7.9): the second part was so much better

**DirtyRat583** (7.4): no sauce but good hyperpop attempt with the outro ig

**jman457** (7.4): It was a cool ending but neither halve lives up to its potential

**beeozan** (7.3): if only it was as good as the sum of its parts

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7): I didn't love the switch up halfway through on the first listen, but it's grown on me. I think it works a lot better here than on ""BITTERSUITE."" This track is an interesting addition to the album as a whole, and feels well suited to come off the high of ""THE GREATEST.""

**donewithbirds** (7): only song on the album that i'm not crazy about but i still like it! transition from the first to the second half goes crazy.

**nooodisaster** (7): The breakdown is amazing, but like most double songs, idk when I'll be in the mood for both halves at once.

**team\_kockroach** (7): I think Billie could benefit from being looser and less controlled with her performance on this song. Still, this builds really well off of songs that were stylistically similar to this on HTE, like Halley’s Comet and Male Fantasy, and this points towards a really good sign for her 4th album. The outro is a banger.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It was pretty catchy until it turned into… whatever that ending was

**welcome2thejam** (7): Kinda Amy Winehouse sound. Oh wait nvm",2,2025-04-12 20:15:24

**camerinian** (9): hacky christmas remixes should be so much more common than they are for the amount of dough they rake in every year, so i’m gonna enjoy the novelty of these unbelievably corny bars while I can

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): we were so funny for this setup idgaf… this is comfortably the most controversial song in the entire rate despite the prohibition of 11s and 0s! and in my opinion, it’s the best song in the bonus rate actually! like sorry you all hate fun and christmas music in March i guess..


**impla77** (5.6): Okay first of all this is a bit of a troll pick and I for one don’t apologise for it. I actually haven’t heard the original of this song all the way through lol but I don’t think I would rate it much higher tbh. Gimmick Christmas lyrics aside I think the quickfire sex puns are just a bit tiring for me. There are some cute lines here but it’s kinda a one and done, I don’t want to revisit this because I’ve already heard the puns!

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): a better song than the original idc

**DirtyRat583** (10): 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

**FluffyNobody** (10): I feel like every pop star should make Christmas versions of their hits

**Frajer** (10): technically this is part of the Emails I Can't Send era but I won't narc

**IIIHenryIII** (10): that was fun

**kauai6** (10): great lyrics

**modulum83** (10): if i had a nickel for every pop star that referenced the name of a classic writer to make a pun about getting dick i'd have two nickels. which isn't a lot but it's weird it happened twice

**RainbowSherbet47** (10): Ya’ll I need it to be Christmas again I despise warm weather and the pollen is awful 😭

**ricki** (10): i just hope whoever thought of making a christmas version of this song got a big raise and some good head

**runaway3212** (10): I think this is beyond horny

**Stryxen** (10): i love nonsense so much it feels so good and welcoming to be treated to a gimmick

**welcome2thejam** (10): There's no amount of sabotage I could do to make this win, right

**WesternWind** (10): this should be a (Christmas) hit, not the original

**TiltControls** (9.5): Just a little step below the other two tracks, but I love the holidayification humour here

**Ambrosia42** (9): christmas isn’t my fave, but it’s so cute lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This silly bitch.

**FitzMarble** (9): just as good as the original

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (9): ""nonsense"" already bops severely and this is the far superior remix (sorry coi leray). I would take a version of this for every holiday. thanksgiving, halloween, st. patrick's day (bed chem...?).

**Lynflower680** (9): Merry Christmas I guess

**nonchalantthoughts** (9): this is camp idgaf

**pig-serpent** (9): Nonsense is a whatever song made great by Sabrina's singing and lyricism, but faced with being an actual song it did have to pull restraint, dropping the sillier and more sexually provocative lyrics only at the end to serve as a sort of twist. Meanwhile the Christmas version is just double entendres from start to finish, and even though I think this format is worse for a song than the original's, it is an excuse to highlight more of Carpenter's lyrics than the original did, which for the most part only had 2-3 good lines. I wouldn't like this if this was a typical remix, ie one that feels more like a replacement or a competitor for the original, where this song feels like a sequel that you could throw on right after the original rather than instead of.

**blueberries929** (8.8): i'm very jewish but NOT when this song is on

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): instant holiday classic

**1998tweety** (8): get that santa dick

**arboresca** (8): yeah this may be my lowest score of the bonus rate but I am a nonsense christmas defender!! it may not be the most artistically brilliant song ever but it is fun and it is sexy and it is clever and funny. Sabrina 100% understood the assignment.

**asadprofessorplum** (8): Why is every modern Christmas pop song able to be mashed up with My Neck My Back?

**Awkward\_King** (8): god its so fun to see a popstar who's so excited about being a popstar and doing silly popstar things.

**buildingigloos** (8): The lyric changes are so fun, but I fear the original nonsense is better. However, maybe March is the wrong month to be rating a Christmas song

**Catalyst** (8): why do I always think Tori Kelly is singing this

**donewithbirds** (8): PULITZER PRIZE!!!

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): she’s so funny but I feel like the final adlib could’ve been funnier / cleverererer

**RandomHypnotica** (8): blud thinks shes on the team (the team being gorgeous movie soundtrack songs)

**seanderlust** (8): this is so stupid i love it kngjfsdfhd

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Charles Dickens… oh girl

**NervousLemon6670** (7.8): Sorry Sabrina, but Eartha Kitt beat you to Santa. As did Michael Buble.

**innuendo\_overdose** (7.6): I’ve never listened to nonsense, is this a parody? somebody explain. this is hilarious.

**stealthamo** (7.5): Bless Sabrina Carpenter for bringing back the shameless Christmas remix.

**Able-Scene6741** (7): last Xmas w/ Chappell snubbed 😤

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7): Rhyming Mrs with Dickens is pretty impressive ngl

**ImADudeDuh** (7): A Sabrina Carpenter Christmas Special was pure cinema

**jman457** (7): Its march I fear, and its no Mariah or The Waitresses.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): sabrina’s entire 2020’s career has been based around making “what the hell, sure” type decisions and i have no choice but to respect her for it

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (6.8): r&b flavored christmas works somewhat here

**Brilliant-Primary500** (6.5): not as funny as it was.

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): How the fuck am I supposed to give a numerical rating to this song? This is a total joke and it knows it. I wanna say I enjoy this but I have no idea.

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): this is better than the original… but it’s still not great

**human\_performance** (6): While the lyrics got a chuckle out of me, the sound just feels like a failed update of the 2019 Ariana Grande sound. No one's doing that better than Ariana

**nooodisaster** (6): you are not gonna make me listen to a christmas song in april. (score from memory)

**pbk** (6): i think nonsense is highly mid but this is a fun reinterpretation at least. im a big fan of sabrina carpenter's whole fun innuendo-laden image if i think literally all of her music before short n sweet is mediocre at best

**Sad-Guidance9105** (6): I would never put this on over regular Nonsense, even during Christmas

**daftsone** (5): It’s not a bad song per se, but it’s not a good Christmas song

**dreamingpastel** (5): Unhinged!

**skylofte2** (5): i will never like christmas music that isn't all i want for christmas is you, christmas wrapping, santa tell me, or snowman...........ESPECIALLY if it's some

**wane them lietoc!** (4.2): this cut does not have the swag that we have determined sabrina carpenter needs. if she ever sings under a hip hop vibe beat like this again, she better be fucking ball and chained to jack harlowe",2,2025-04-12 20:26:50

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): song for 15 year olds who still use precious little cinnamon roll to describe fictional male characters

**darj** (6): kinda mixed on this one. Doing the kinda chilled TF out groovy smooth jazz pastiche is funny. It’s so on the nose you’d think it’s an original 1981 song that went on to become a 2011 vaporwave classic. Sometimes I do feel like people oversell Sabrina’s lyrical humor idk the Shakespeare joke lyric feels clunky and forced, like she’s rushing to cram the joke into the verses

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): maybe it’s because I grew up with a lot of people with different accents regional or National but I really don’t get the fuss people make of them.

**innuendo\_overdose** (5.5): okay so I have a theory that this was placed on the album for purely cold, cynical reasons. The rest of the album seems a tad unlikely for radio play (except Birds of a Feather ofc, that shit’s a juggernaut), so this song was added as bland milquetoast MOR filler to release to radio/playlists and tide her over by inoffending the boomers and working as textural wallpaper to not make people reach to skip when it came on shuffle. Does anybody go out of their way to listen to this? It’s so mid it’s mid.

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (3): Biggest skip for me on the album. It's vibe-y, and if I'm in the right mood I'm game, but it feels too much like a rehash of OG Billie rather than an authentic part of the album. I'm not mad it's here, but I wouldn't care if it was deleted from the track list either.

Love the octave hopping (I beg you, don't EMBARRASS MEEEE MOTHERfuuckkERRR), and the songwriting and lyricism is really fun here.

**bigbigbee** (7): So much fun as a premise for a song, and the lyrics are funny and cute, so I support this song, but got overplayed extremely quickly for me

**CrimsonROSET** (7): yeah the key change is fun but imo it was always the worst single

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7): I can't with the ""I know you're craving some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice"" lyric ☠️.

**nooodisaster** (7): put me in the ""i dont think ive ever seen someone fumble a second single this hard. my goodness"" section

**pig-serpent** (7): This is a solid ballad but I prefer the Dolly Parton version because the mixing on the instrumental is better and I think it has the better vocals from Sabrina. Don't really care about Dolly on it though. Actually I wish she wasn't there because the only thing stopping that version from being a 10 is removing ""motherfucker,"" which is the best part of this version.

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.5): get up

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): this song is much better than the one viral clip. I do think it’s funny to release a song about how your partner from a differently country definitely already making you anxious he’s going to humiliate you is funny to release as you publicly date someone from another country even if it was written before. I really get why people get vague country vibe from her music.

**arboresca** (4.5): never really vibed with the song like I did with the other singles.

**nonchalantthoughts** (4): this doesn't have the ""wow"" factor for me. The production is fine, but it just feels so bare-bones. I also just feel like the songwriting was tailor-made for TikTok, since it wanted to follow the footsteps of the virality of ""Expresso"".

**Awkward\_King** (6): realising that this kind of feels like transitioning from HTE and guitar songs to hmhas. some of my favourite lyrics on the album

**Baelyana** (6): i don't go back to her a lot unfortunately

**FitzMarble** (6): this is a total snoozer I’m sorry. strings are great tho

**ktajlili** (6): It sounds gorgeous, but I can't help but rolling my eyes at the cliche of ""People think I am so happy because I had a glow up but I am actually sad."" Also, the last album had a ""Here's how I'm doing intro."" Billie, do something different, please!

**letsallpoo** (6): losing weight and learning to love the older version of yourself is such a real ass struggle and I love how Billie approaches the topic here. the song is still a little boring though

**runaway3212** (6): I just kinda think this idea is done better on HTE

**skylofte2** (6): i need her to speak up

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this seemed to hit alot harder for most people than for me

**Soalai** (5.9): Her lyrics are always good, but soncially it doesn't get going until the strings part at the end

**Ambrosia42** (5.5): Reflecting on changes in her body (and comments about it), time passing, and fame. Growing up in the spotlight would be weird I’m sure. This track kind of bores me i fear though

**bespectacIed** (5): (edtwt alt) hmm not really

**human\_performance** (5): It might be a little unfair to come to this after the sugar rush of Olivia Rodrigo, but man, I'm already bored and the internet lyrical reference however true it is made me roll my eyes

**fair-profile-8367** (3): The outro with 'THE GREATEST''s melody playing in the background is beautiful

**kauai6** (3): quite boring, it does not hit

**pig-serpent** (3): When Billie makes this kind of soft, willowy song there's a 50/50 chance of her putting a unique spin on it that makes it worth listening to. This song is a case of her making a nothing burger chamber pop song.

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (2.9): whispering with no substance or energy along with weak accompanying production trying to hard to convey softness ends debilitated

**Treecoh** (1): SO boring. Wild choice of an opener. I heard this and immediately wrote off the rest of the album thinking Billie has regressed back to her whispering days. Glad the rest of the album proved me wrong.

Also not unique to her but I do think there’s a lot of confusion of suffering with depth in of itself in the arts and it’s just like no you have to say something behind that especially bc you’ve literally already said this before multiple times.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The Over Now Extended Edit did kinda outsell but this version is still great.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): the remix kinda outsold actually

**darj** (3): I once shazam’d in a store the Over Now Extended Edit which I like sooo much more https://youtu.be/3WSIpxukIO8?si=g432STsQOkxpE1C8",2,2025-04-12 20:15:32

**UselessTacooo** (4): this anti-smasha

**vayyiqra** (4): dumb lol

**bespectacIed** (3): Eugh. Not funny, very heavy-handed.

**ktajlili** (3): I don't like that it's the same song but with different lyrics...don't do that.

**sfouou** (3): it's not funny, sorry. i need a charles dickens??? come on

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): love Nonsense but I can barely do Christmas music in December

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (2.7): I love the original but this doesn’t really work for me

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (2): I think Ariana is the last new Christmas song I’ve ever liked

**fair-profile-8367** (2): A fun Christmas song, but the OG is SO much better!

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (1): This is sooooooo cruel making this Sab's bonus track 💀 I mean, timing wise I get why, but please (please please). Anyway, I don't like this song and I haven't since it first came out lol. I like ""Nonsense"" a lot (knew it was a hit first time I heard it), but this version just feels silly in a way that's not my taste. Epitome of Sabrina's sex shtick being driven into the ground IMO. Nothing but love though <3

**flava** (1): i already hate nonsense for a lot of the same reasons i hate espresso so…

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (1): Christmas music and children choirs, the bane of my existence

**krusso1105** (1): NO CHRISTMAS MUSIC IN MARCH

**oh\_crow** (1): its not quite a zero but i hate fun and i hate this version of this song

**uiscebeathaoir** (1): Idk man it’s her usual schtick but it feels oddly soulless. She really did the original dirty here",1,2025-04-12 20:26:56

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): Bonusphobia and countryphobia comes together to snipe Bad Reviews out of the rate. And it’s a bit underrated for me!! Even though the subject matter is very 😐 Sabrina has enough charm to make this work well!

**camerinian** (7): funny concept to leave the audience associating your project with “bad reviews” but this is just nice! Doesn’t hit as hard as a closer as on the standard issue and there’s a bit of missed potential with the concept, but Sabrina’s delivery makes this hard to really hate. I give this five bags of popcorn.

**impla77** (6.1): I keep forgetting this song exists, I just don’t have anything to say about it. It exists. It has lyrics. It certainly is a song on Short n’ Sweet (Deluxe) by Sabrina Carpenter.

---

# **GOOD Reviews**

**1998tweety** (10): i need a full country album from her

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The jokes will write themselves but those jokes are wrong because this song is gorgeous!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): that instrumental breakdown alone deserves the win

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (10): like another song of hers starting with the word ""bad"" (""bad for business"" my beloved), this song gets paid dust--but not by me! it's got a beautiful wistfulness, connects back to Px3 (the judgment line) and Lie to Girls (she'll ignore the red flags because she loves him) and the aforementioned Bad for Business (she'll cut off her friends for him), contains a non-sexual double entendre (""just want someone to love me [,] who doesn't""), and has a quintessential sabrina lyric (""I can't lose another boy that's not even my boyfriend"")

**TiltControls** (10): Lil cheeky, but still an incredibly fun listen

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.5): bringing in the violin solo from “Ode to Clio” by Man/Woman/Chainsaw wasn’t really what I expected. Sabrina deserves a monopoly on country crossovers. (The Giver can stay)

**FakeMonaLisa28** (9): i honestly love the country elements in this song

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): Lovely fiddles, lovely turns of phrase

**beeozan** (8.5): wait why is this clearing most of the main album

**NervousLemon6670** (8.5): Don't Smile is a better album closer but this is definitely a short and sweet addition

**stealthamo** (8.5): I'd have no complaints about Sabrina going in a more country route.

**wathombe** (8.5): fun little ditty to wrap up the deluxe

**Baelyana** (8): short n' sweet ending to a great album

**bogo** (8): good reviews

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is the yeehawest

**fair-profile-8367** (8): My only complaint is that I wish it was longer

**FluffyNobody** (8): at 2:22 you could say it's short 'n sweet

**runaway3212** (8): she is beautiful and she is loved I had bad reviews too

**skylofte2** (8): relatable

**jman457** (7.7): cute ending

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I like when she gets a little country with it (part 2)

**emayzee** (7.5): her reading her twitter mentions when the snippet of her oat milk latte song was being relentlessly dragged

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): Sabrina’s letterbox is full of quip reviews i just know it

**seanderlust** (7.5): ooh i like her voice at the end. a little dolly parton-y

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): Works much better as an album closer than Don’t Smile. The fiddle-playing on the bridge is beautiful

**ignitethephoenix** (7.4): Barry’s dick was just that powerful huh

**ConnerY2323** (7.1): a pleasant note to go out on

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): at least you're getting reviews glances at Starfucker

**buildingigloos** (7): Not a massive fan of the country songs on here, and comparing it as an album closer to Don't Smile, it's even weaker.

**donewithbirds** (7): i cannot fucking imagine how deeply annoying it must be to have the public give a verdict on your relationship and then act like it was a foregone conclusion when it ends. like even if it's bad and the public was right i would want to stay in it out of spite. this is how grimes happens

**implasdad** (7): its ok.

**kauai6** (7): much better vocals on this compared to some of her other country esque songs on this album

**ricki** (7): emilia perez

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): I will not be giving this album a bad review

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Why does this sound like Planet Coaster music

**WesternWind** (7): bratmanfamstan to all the girlies in the rate

**Able-Scene6741** (6.5): girl the reviewers were right lol

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (6.5): I really enjoy the strings. Especially the break for the fiddle. But also what miserable song to end the album with about being so lonely you cut off friends for a guy who’s not even your boyfriend and even if telling you is bad news.

**blueberries929** (6.3): ouch?

# **[insert monkey pissing in mouth video here]**

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (6): It's interesting that while the album itself leaned more 80's nostalgia, Sabrina went real country on the deluxe. Funny how she and Olivia both did that... Billie, is the HMHAS deluxe going to be country? /s

**arboresca** (6): production sounds kinda like slim pickins but I do like it, her self deprecating lyrics are great.

**asadprofessorplum** (6): But enough about Katy Perry’s 143

**Brilliant-Primary500** (6): it's alright but like, boring pop done well isn't for someone like me.

**daftsone** (6): Is this a prediction of how this song will fare?

**human\_performance** (6): while there's a lot of country inspired material on the main album, I can't help but feel this was written to really cash in on the current country turn in top-40

**modulum83** (6): she wrote this about rateyourmusic.com

**nooodisaster** (6): its cute

**sfouou** (5.5): i give this song a meh review

**Ambrosia42** (5.2): kinda forgettable I fear

**Awkward\_King** (5): she sounds so much like miley at the beginning of this song to me

**oh\_crow** (5): i genuinely can't tell if the songs have gotten worse of if this parcticular sound has just worn its welcome by this point for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): if this was a song where she was telling her haters to fuck off it mightve been a 10

**vayyiqra** (5): The rehab line was ? but also, why was there so much country on this album. It's not a bad genre, I'm not bashing it, I'm just puzzled.

**wane them lietoc!** (4.2): why she writing a train ditty? is this train? is sabrina pulling on my chain?!

**pig-serpent** (4): Very excited to hear about how this plan works out on her next album.

**qazz23** (4): sry i have to give this song one

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i can't even remember what this sounds like so what does that tell you

**indie\_fan\_** (3.5): girl.. stand up!!

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.4): safe country sounding and easy to digest

**DaHumanTorch** (3): we need to stop the guitar plucking next album

**jirachi** (3): i don't know what possessed this woman to sing this but never again please

**pbk** (3): when she announced the deluxe i was praying it wouldnt be a bunch of mid ballads and yet.",5,2025-04-11 19:55:09

**camerinian** (6.5): i can hardly say I'm surprised this came in last, cos even though i don't dislike it, there's an uncanny valley this kinda falls into with Sabrina’s humour here, like some of the jokey lines here could probably work somewhere else, but on this stripped back ballad all it does is kinda cause side-eye. I thought there was potential here but it's the kind of track that feels almost antithetical to Sabrina’s appeal, and that weird vibe was reflected in this result

**impla77** (5.6): And our last place, I’m sure to no one's surprise. This track racked up the most 0s in the rate, and was pretty much in dead last from the get go. And I kinda get it, but honestly I’ve warmed to this one in the meantime (a danger in locking in your scores as the rate started and listening to the albums a shitload after). There’s a lot of lyrics I think are very pithy, such as the love it or hate it Leonard Cohen line. I can just IMAGINE that type of pseudo intellectual man (whose name may or may not rhyme with sawn denmes). Unfortunately an understated guitar ballad was not going to cut it in in a rate full of bops.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): This was pretty much the punching bag of the rate - most controversial, last by 60 points, most 0… She can’t catch a break! And I can’t say it’s not deserved. One of my musical pet peeves is songs shorter than 2:30, and at 2:13 this cut just come and go without quite any impression.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): Popheads says NO to liars as Sabrina completes the bottom 3 sweep with understated cut Lie to Girls. One of the many downtempo Sabrina cuts on this album, I think the subject matter is pretty interesting! Unfortunately the sonical element is pretty indistinguisable from the various ballads in this rate, making this placement justifiable.

**camerinian** (6): this score is mostly cos i think the melody is very pretty and i actually think the texture on the guitar at the end is a cool touch, otherwise uhhhh this is a weird fit and the attitude is…

**impla77** (5.6): Rounding out the reverse podium… we have Sabrina again AND we are losing MULTIPLE 11s with this one! This track has never worked for me just because I’m kinda like speak for yourself bestie, it’s just something I don’t relate to so I’m rolling my eyes a bit for sure at some of the lyrics and the melody is kinda meh. Honestly I was expecting this to place a little higher but I’m not upset :)

---

# **Lying is the most fun a girl can … ok you get the point**

**wathombe** (11): so incisive, so clever, so many great turns of phrase, and absolutely full of great melodies; i cannot get enough of this song

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (10): The thing about Sabrina is that she can write a second verse. You know how people are like oh, Taylor is the queen of bridges, etc.? Sabrina is the queen of second verses. There's just something so perfect about the flow, melody, and build of her delivery and the lyrics -- it is literally cathartic to sing it. It's not just this song either; she shows the same strength on ""decode"" and ""Tornado Warnings,"" just to name a couple... I don't know a lot of artists that can make the second verse the star of the song rather than just filler for the rest. Anyway, I can play this on repeat for days. Criminally overlooked.

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): this is the closest this album gets to sounding like it could fit on a indie essentials list, the production sounds like a mixture between A&W and maybe idk Radiohead? There’s definitely something I’m sensing, but lol I’m not good at enough at writing about music to carry that out, this is my stupidest comment ever.

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.5): Can I take a second to say that all three albums have incredible lyrics but in completely unique ways personal to each of them. Olivia has blunt confessional honesty, Billie has a grand conceptual scope (+ pussy), and Sabrina has the tight intricate humour and wordplay that colour even her most emotional songs. Of the three, Sabrina’s style might narrowly be my favourite

**blueberries929** (9.1): Is relating to this song as a guy cultural appropriation?

**FluffyNobody** (9): it's a bit of a downer coming after Juno, but I love the songwriting

**IIIHenryIII** (9): just son’t

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (8.5): this song made me very sad especially the lines about her being like her mother and sisters like this. I enjoyed the the tarot lines.

**wane them lietoc!** (8.5): sending this to dua lipa because I heard Boys Will Be Boys for the first time last month and almost died.

**Ambrosia42** (8.2): that moment when you desperately need to break up but you keep telling yourself and your friends that it’s fine

**arboresca** (8): this is the best ballad on this album...but the whiplash between this & Juno is insane

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I wanna say this will be so robbed, but it’s also technically one of my lower scores in the rate soooo.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): but the butterflies are in your stomach- where are you feeling your cardiac arrest

**Frajer** (8): she want's Kacey's nachos

**jirachi** (8): i'm coming to save you

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): the outro slaps and lowkey makes the song

**Able-Scene6741** (7.5): goofy but I am the girl outside the stripcpub getting my tarot cards read

**flava** (7.5): i like this one a bit but I don’t support lying to girls, even if it is girls lying to girls

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7.5): ""I'm stupid but I'm clever/yeah I can make a shitshow look a whole lot like forever"" is the thesis of the album. I always thought that the bit at the end with the guitar and the synth drone was similar to the end of ""decode"" from eics, and what do you know, she adds the end of ""decode"" on to the end of this song on tour

**jman457** (7.3): she’s a cute album cut

**bigbigbee** (7): I think Sabrina sometimes has some lyrics that feel like placeholders, and I feel it especially in songs like this, which sound so nice but has chorus lyrics that could have used a second or third draft

**daftsone** (7): It risked being a bit boring but really picked up by the end of it

**donewithbirds** (7): shoutout to the girl outside the strip club getting her tarot cards read. it's gonna be okay, queen

**fair-profile-8367** (7): Love the second verse!

**ktajlili** (7): I don't think this is the best song of the album, but the lyrics ""You don't have to lie to girls. If they like you, they will lie to themselves"" just fits so perfectly thematically with the rest of the album and is just so relatable.

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): S(he) Be(lie)ve(d)

**team\_kockroach** (7): This beat captures everything good about Melodrama. Wish Sabrina paired it with a better chorus though.

**modulum83** (6.8): ""I hate when GIRLS die"" -@youngthug, 12:17 AM Jul 5, 2017

**dys-fx-al** (6.5): so true bestie

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): the emails is coming out in full here",4,2025-04-11 19:16:17

**camerinian** (9): the most tragic victim of balladphobia this round i fear, like guys are we actually sitting with these lyrics or are we just going on mental autopilot as soon as we hear strumming, this shit is sad as hell! And frightening in a sort of existential way! The writing is so good and we are just neglecting it smh

**impla77** (7.5): Underrated methinks, by the raterbase as a whole and also by past me (I would give this a 10 now). I just love the conceit of this song, the temptation to continue things on due to inertia rather than actually having conviction in the relationship, and hence having to squash the doubt constantly. Also Olivia is 100% the villain here, I’m scared of this happening in a relationship fr fr 😢 We love a multi faceted queen.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): Our first Olivia song out is a bonus track! It’s got some nice vocal moments, but to me it’s just a typical Olivia ballad, so I’m not surprised it ended up so low.

---
# **On the front lines for ballad rights**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): OVERHATED IDC!!! It’s such a hard line of ‘heyyyy maybe my art is too personal’ especially in a field where those vulnerabilities are looked up to, and it’s such an interesting subject!!! If this song has one fan it’s me!!!

**flava** (10): so many people claim to stan Olivia for the relatable but melodramatic and heartbreaking content in her music and then they pay this to dust. Like I’m sorry but this could be her best song along with obsessed. Being scared of the thing you love, the thing you do as your work because you’re worried it will reveal your true emotions about a partner to not only him, but to yourself is just sad. It’s painfully self-aware, and trying its best to not be because something does feel off but maybe this could be good enough, all she’d have to do is sacrifice even more of her life to the relationship.

**kauai6** (10): she sings spectacular on this song

**Able-Scene6741** (9): gut wrenching :(

**daftsone** (9): I too am scared of musical instruments

**pig-serpent** (9): This song helped Olivia become less scared of her guitar, and likewise made me less afraid of listening to her acoustic guitar.

**runaway3212** (9): lyrically the slay and sonically it also exists

**asadprofessorplum** (8.5): Pop stars are sooo lucky they don’t have to use LinkedIn

**Baelyana** (8.3): if she was going to put a ballad on it should've been this one

**modulum83** (8.3): who snuck a taylor song onto this album

**wane them lietoc!** (8.3): how the fuck do you get scared of your guitar? yr not goddamn kevin shields girl

**arboresca** (8): I really love the storytelling of this one, & I think it's pretty true. art doesn't lie.

**darj** (8): taylor when she started working on 1989 be like…idk am I doing this right

**dys-fx-al** (8): oh...

**Frajer** (8): when Chucky possesses my guitar

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): I am also scared of guitars

**NervousLemon6670** (7.9): Gets a little too repetitive towards the end

**emayzee** (7.8): i love when songs personify guitars

**blueberries929** (7.7): So am I but because blisters hurt like a bitch

**jman457** (7.7): The bridge sells it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This could have definitely been on the standard album over logical.

**human\_performance** (7.5): for whatever reason, this ballad feels like it breathes more, with more space than the other ballads

**bigbigbee** (7): this is just like that scene in Hannah Montana where she wistfully sings If We Were A Movie to herself about that Jake guy and Dolly Parton comforts her

**bogo** (7): girl we are too put it away

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7): this very sad, me sad now, me go cry, me not want play guitar, huh huh.

**donewithbirds** (7): my bunny relates to this; one time my guitar case tipped over and made a loud noise and he avoids that thing like the plague now

**Straight-Meaning** (7): good but not one that attracts me

**Stryxen** (7): the concept of olivia doing a country album would be very scary to many but i kinda believe if she really committed to it she would gag. That said, if you’re reading this godlivia, please don’t

**uiscebeathaoir** (7): Yeah I’m scared of your guitar too Olivia where’s the nu disco

**wathombe** (7): this one has just never grabbed me

**akanewasright** (6.7): this is an extremely real sentiment, and (no joke) I basically accidentally confessed my feelings for a friend by covering the wrong song during a shared set… but sonically this doesn’t do that much for me

**implasdad** (6.7): pleasant enough

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.5): me but its a weird lamp my aunt has

# **scared of falling asleep**

**nooodisaster** (6): then like... just put it away??

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): a very nothing song but i don't hate it

**vayyiqra** (6): Was going to joke ""and yet you write many songs on it, interesting"" but eh no. Too serious for that.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): You don’t have to put EVERY song on the deluxe you know

**WesternWind** (6): get some therapy honey, thats not normal

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): [BOO!!!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar)

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (5.2): Pretty, but doesn't really make a huge impact. Her voice sounds lovely.

**buildingigloos** (5): he's the reason that I'm scared of my guitar

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): wasn’t this the deluxe track that most people were really hyped about?

**hikk** (5): i'm scared of your guitar too... put it down pls

**innuendo\_overdose** (5): I have a pet hate about pop songwriters who don’t have the imagination or vision to write about anything that isn’t five feet in front of their noses because it leads to lines like “I can’t write a song that’s not about you” (or goddamn Bernie Taupin with his “I’m a musicman” bullshit in every goddamn song) which everybody fucking does and it’s all fucking shit and I don’t think they appreciate how vapid and unimaginative that is and how pointless it all is.the song is alright.

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (5): perfectly cromulent ballad that did not need to be over 4 minutes long

**kerriekipje** (5): BORINGGG

**oh\_crow** (5): i'd be scared of your guitar too if it leads to more songs like this aha ha

**seanderlust** (5): i'm starting to think that o-rod ballads just overall aren't for me outside of driver's license and maybe hope ur ok.

**ConnerY2323** (4.5): i’m 17 and AFRAID of my guitar

**UselessTacooo** (4.5): in no world did this need to be 4 and a half minutes

**Ambrosia42** (4): corny af

**DirtyRat583** (4): as you should be PUT IT AWAY! and the piano too

**FluffyNobody** (4): I can see why this was a bonus song

**IIIHenryIII** (4): acoustic doesn’t suit you, girl

**jirachi** (4): as you should be. when are you making gay people synthpop olivia???

**pbk** (4): girl maybe you should be im yawning

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.9): too folky and vapid in sonics

**beeozan** (3): are u not holding it rn

**RandomHypnotica** (3): if this is what happens with it i understand!

**Awkward\_King** (2): unfortunately a song i think i have no recollection of the second it ends. she's scared of a memorable hook too

**ktajlili** (2): At her worst, Olivia is emotional, bordering on melodrama. While I think her anxiety is relatable, manifesting it as being literally scared of her guitar is corny and stupid.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): first ever asian person to get their maths wrong (i’m asian i can make this comment)

**impla77** (5.2): Olivia makes her first appearance in the rate with you guessed it.. a ballad! I don’t mind this one and actually would rate it slightly higher now but it very much is a generic Olivia piano ballad and a weak link off an extremely strong album. The 2 + 2 line is whatever to me even though it makes me think of Radiohead which makes me sad but I LOVE the bridge. Its so raw and vulnerable and Olivia really sells it. Unfortunately then we lead into the outro which is a bit of a snooze. Overall I can see why this is the last place Olivia if NOT for a bonus track which I find unforgivable.

**camerinian** (3): idk man olivia has such a naturalistic way of writing metaphors that when it feels strained, it seriously doesn’t hit. Add in a very un-memorable melody and a pretty bare production that does not even remotely pay off the opportunity the bridge gave it? Yeah not too beat up about this one goin.

# **Followers of Aristotle**

**bogo** (10): if this song has 0 defenders i am dead

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Heartbreaking

**Standard-Ad-7249** (10): the amount of tears i've cried to this song

**Able-Scene6741** (9.5): the fact that this is the worst song on the og guts is crazy cuz this is still a MASTERPIECE

**modulum83** (9.3): olivia is kind of the female equivalent of a midwest emo vocalist. like you hand these pathetic ass lyrics to the guy from mom jeans or free throw and it works just as well

**daftsone** (9): Bad maths never sounded so good

**ConnerY2323** (8.8): really heartfelt and not labored songwriting

**runaway3212** (8.5): Is this song good? No but she performs it incredibly

**Straight-Meaning** (8.5): very pretty, not her best ballad but still a good song

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.5): We love extended outros in this house

**innuendo\_overdose** (8.3): the American education system, everybody

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): the bridge and outro truly make the song for me. the outro is particularly heartbreaking. i just hate how clunky some melodies are in the chorus

**ruhroh386** (7.5): but that bridge is a ten

**Soalai** (7.5): The music itself is kinda mid but the lyrics are great, and the tour performance where she's sitting on the moon helps bump it up for me

**arboresca** (7): my favorite ballad so far, the emotion in her vocals gives me chills, especially in the bridge. she really gets to show off on the ballads on this album in general.

**asadprofessorplum** (7): Honestly proud of her for not even using the word gaslighter once.

**donewithbirds** (7): i don't love the lyrics on this one but olivia's performance SELLS it she's such an emotive vocalist

**FluffyNobody** (7): this is one of her weaker ballads unfortunately

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7): started at a 6 and then the bridge pulled it up a notch, especially the emotion in her voice at ""I look so stupid thinking""

**krusso1105** (7): I remember liking this when I first listened to the album but it has grown off me quite a bit I fear

**pbk** (7): im sorry i like this one ik that it is considered a stinker usually but i think its pretty good even if its a lil corny

**skylofte2** (7): is this the girl math they speak of

**Ambrosia42** (6.8): someone get this girl set up with a math tutor, quick

**implasdad** (6.8): ok. no great shakes

**kauai6** (6.7): a bit too sad for me

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (6.7): sonically nice but falls short with mediocre chorus lyric

**ricki** (6.6): i skipped this all time but now im kinda listening something…. it’s 3am and im doing this at the literal last minute so ill just bump it an entire point and hope i dont regret that

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**bigbigbee** (6.5): insert that video of the horse playing the piano with its mouth

**human\_performance** (6.5): The bridge is nice

# **HATES Vulcans**

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): I’m so glad she and this guy aren’t together bc being with a man who says you’re too young while also choosing to date you is upsetting to hear about it. Also neat to see Julia Michaels in the writing credits! I’m glad to see her not only work with Dan.

**flava** (6): love may not be logical but it is definitely embarrassing

**IIIHenryIII** (6): strongest Barbz U graduate

**ktajlili** (6): I think this one might be a bit overhated? Sure, the lyrics are a bit dumb. But the arrangments and vocals are beautiful !!

**pig-serpent** (6): I've always called this my favorite ballad on the album because it's catchy but honestly outside of that there's nothing here. Maybe I just don't like any of her ballads.

**Sad-Guidance9105** (6): Sounds nice but better ballads are available

**slimboyfriend** (6): where’s popheads’ resident Julia Michaels hater when you need them

**vayyiqra** (6): 😔

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Can we make Olivia sign an agreement that she can't put ballads next to each other on her tracklists anymore?

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (5.5): NGL I'm surprised most people think this is the weakest on the album. Yes, it's in the vein of her original recipe ballads, but since we haven't had any of those on the album yet (sans vampire, if you count that), I think it fits fine! I like the outro a lot.

**fair-profile-8367** (5.5): It's not my favourite on the album, but with a bridge and an outro like that, it's incredibly underrated

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): please send Julia Michaels back to Sabrina

**sfouou** (5.5): ""loving every jump cut argument""

**team\_kockroach** (5.5): Better chorus than Lacy but still a dreary ballad of a similar nature. The last verse where most of the instrumentation drops out is cool as hell.

**bespectacIed** (5): Eugh. She can sang though

**Stryxen** (5): she knew she couldn't make a skipless album this early in her career so she stilll has people tapping in for her new albums as they have a constant upward trend

**welcome2thejam** (5): Boooo go back to rocking

**jman457** (4.6): sounds like a sour Ballad (boring)

**buildingigloos** (4): I'm just balladphobic

**TiltControls** (4): well she didn't go to fucking school for math

**akanewasright** (3): This is the one bad ballad on the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): God this song really doesn’t fit on the album at ALL (it’s ass)

**CrimsonROSET** (0): and fuck the logical song too",3,2025-04-11 19:31:57

**camerinian** (8.5): her blister in the sun slay! kinda! anyone else hear it! No?! Okay!!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): Please leave the country music shtick to Sabrina. I don’t know how this escaped the bottom 5 but it should have stayed there!!

**impla77** (0): God I hate this fucking song, it’s so disconcerting. Why does she sound like that??? Why are we doing this campfire singalong???? WHY DOES SHE SOUND LIKE THAT?????

---

# **Ready to whip the acoustic guitar out**

**fair-profile-8367** (11): ""And I can't say I'm a perfect 10"" No, but I would say you're a perfect 11

**Awkward\_King** (10): is ska kind of so back?? billie turned black and olivia turned white simultaneously

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): You can really hear the 90s Women Who Rock daughter she is with this one.

**darj** (10): welcome back Edie Brickell - What I Am yasssss

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): acoustic guitar swing, this is what we love to see. This is what woke John Dowland would write.

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): oh she’s reaching for joni mitchell’s nachos

**TiltControls** (10): This is going to likely get trashed but this is such a good throwback to that 2000's rom-com acoustic soundtrack sound

**wathombe** (10): none of you know edie and it shows

**emayzee** (9.4): love this suddenly i see moment

**bespectacIed** (9): switch the acoustic guitar with some left-field percussions and string instruments, this is a Fiona song

**Restless\_Dill16** (9): I would give this a higher score if it was a minute longer.

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): So 00’s One Hit Wonder core

**wane them lietoc!** (9): kinda fuck with it

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): an overhated smasha

**jman457** (8.2): A great acoustic moment, I hope she does more of this

**stealthamo** (8.2): This just founds like a fun jam session.

**akanewasright** (8): this kinda sounds like a demo or solo acoustic rendition of a full band song, but it’s insanely catchy and I kinda love it

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8): I don't know if there's any actual info on this, but I firmly believe this was an alternate track she wrote for Lucy Gray / Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and I will not be changed on that notion. It just fits so perfectly, like the lyrics are as straightforward as it could get. Regardless, I love this song and it's the best of the bonus tracks by far. Again, Joni Mitchell realness is what we need in this economy!!!!! Want a whole folksy album like this from her.

**Ambrosia42** (8): okay miss olivia parton

**Frajer** (8): she was briefly possessed by Kesha

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): okay miss olivia twain!! the over-the-top delivery charms me here

**pbk** (8): everyones always like oh guts deluxe only has 2 good songs but theyre wrong theres 3 this one is good

**blueberries929** (7.8): underrated masterpiece!!!

**modulum83** (7.8): the pop girls gone country trend is so powerful it even took olivia...scary

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): wait... why did she kinda out yee sabrina's haw

**Soalai** (7.8): I could see this in a 2000s chick flick, it's kinda Traveling Pants coded

**NervousLemon6670** (7.7): Why does this have KT Turnstall vibes?

**Able-Scene6741** (7.5): cute but liv pls don’t go country give us that rock love album pls & thank u

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7.5): I love the last aaah so much and the simmering anger

**runaway3212** (7.5): girl take the cowboy hat off

**Baelyana** (7.4): this one grew on me a lot

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the asylums she grew up in or whatever the line is

**daftsone** (7): Short and sweet … wait, this isn’t Sabrina…

**donewithbirds** (7): bare but fun! love olivia's vocal delivery on this, would love to hear her do more stuff like this

**FluffyNobody** (7): I didn't expect the cuntry turn! her voice sounds different here

**nooodisaster** (7): its cute

**Stryxen** (7): she just had to fuck it up fjghkfjgh, okay taking this for what it is it’s actually very well written, i knowww my queen laura marling was on that moodboard, but the production sounds cheap and this does not suit her voice even slightly.

**implasdad** (6.7): started well but tapered off. i like the guitar playing.

**arboresca** (6.5): close enough welcome back Lucy Gray

**human\_performance** (6.5): The country experiment here doesn't quite fit Miss Olivia. Praying that she doesn't get captured by the Walmart mind virus for her next album

**seanderlust** (6.5): yeehaw

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): yeah this and the next one really scream deluxe track lol

**asadprofessorplum** (6.2): Sheryl Crow what are you doing here

# **Cruel beyond your years**

**bluepupz** (6): This is my only song below a 7 in the entire rate lol. It's so short that it feels like it goes nowhere; it gives interlude vibes. I don't actively dislike this, but it gets a big ole shrug from me.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (6): oh wow, country-pop Olivia, it's like unlocking a new shiny but like, she sounds like a Taylor Swift knock-off this time and she should never go down this route.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): It's very Taylor coded.

**Sad-Guidance9105** (6): the random country moment

**Straight-Meaning** (6): not my favorite, it just not one of her best

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Idk how to explain why but if this and obsessed were one track I think I would rate it higher

**beeozan** (5.4): the Mitchie Torres in her awakened

**bigbigbee** (5): very Target ad

**ImADudeDuh** (5): wdym this isn’t a sabrina carpenter song?

**ricki** (5): in an alternate universe this is in the soundtrack for a movie starring zoey deschanel

**slimboyfriend** (5): some odd coffeehouse-core drag going on here

**vayyiqra** (5): Mm kind of twee (the mood, not the genre). Sorry Olivia but this one kind of belongs back in 2006.

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4.1): quite country and deviating from main album

**ConnerY2323** (4): halsey??

**dys-fx-al** (4): i respect the folksy-ness and it sounds like it belongs on that hunger games movie but idk if i like it

**kauai6** (4): okay country

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): song that plays in the trailer for the most insufferably quirky coming of age indie romcom you’ve ever seen where the song ends up playing a major role in the movie itself in the last twenty minutes

**sfouou** (3.4): jumpscare! what the hell is this?

**goodbyesindisguise** (3): that guitar … is just not for me

**hikk** (3): this is so scary... should have kept this in the drafts queen

**IIIHenryIII** (3): that’s a filler, even for a deluxe album

**indie\_fan\_** (2): :confusedsob:

**1998tweety** (0): not everyone needs to do country

**jirachi** (0): i am so uncomfortable.

**ktajlili** (0): While this song is fascinating lyrically, the terrible country accent makes it completely unlistenable.

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): the fake country accent, always copying taylor smh",4,2025-04-11 19:49:22

**camerinian** (6.5): feels pretty damning of Sabrina's entire schtick that her “literally just a dick joke” song still scraped bottom like this (ehehehe)

**impla77** (5.8): So I’m not the first to say this (hi dad) but yes this is basically a rip off of ‘Hopelessly Devoted To You’ and that’s really all I can think about when I hear it lol.  I guess I never really got this vibe before reading the comments here, but I can see the double entendres here now too and yeah… maybe I just want a completely sincere Sabrina some of the time. This definitely feels like a bonus track, which to be honest is how I feel about all these Sabrina bonus tracks (though we shall see if the raterbase disagrees with me with these rate results!)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.7): Balladphobia is real and alive! I think these strings are gorgeous but this is a bonus cut and it shows unfortunately, so this placements make sense!

---
# **8=========D**

**goodbyesindisguise** (10): stop sleeping on this song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! >:(

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.4): the fact that I’m thinking “is this emotional or about dick?” is proof she’s the best to ever do it

**emayzee** (9): this is so main character in a musical after the major conflict of the movie just happened

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I love the old school vibe

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): we love a beautifully vintage ballad that’s also an extended dick joke. blue balls queen!

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): This is exactly the type of song Dolly Parton would be writing if she’d been born 5 decades later

**wathombe** (9): i love this track and am now dying for sabrina and orville to collaborate

**1998tweety** (8.5): she reheated those nachos

**Frajer** (8.5): does Sabrina like horny puns this is brand new information

**dys-fx-al** (8.2): the vocals *chef's kiss

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): She loves herself a country ballad and you know what she’s good at making them!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): but what if you’re good enough sabrina

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): if you changed the fuckboy lyric and added a scratchy record filter this could pass for a song from the late 50s that people didn't realize charted at #1 for a week and then became a classic in like italy or something

**ricki** (7.7): is the innuendo intentional or do i have a porn addiction

**UselessTacooo** (7.7): patiently waiting for the lawsuit

**donewithbirds** (7): felt like i was at a 50s prom until she said the word ""fuckboys""

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is very “there are worse things I could do” coded

**jirachi** (7): this sounds like a dusty springfield melody

**ruhroh386** (7): would fit in with the 90s country girlies

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): Versatile

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sometimes Sabrina's lyrics give me like… ghostwritten by a gay twink vibes

**WesternWind** (7): aw what a cute ballad

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): this extremely horny woman seriously wasted a title this good on a boring ballad...

**human\_performance** (6.5): the ""fuckboys"" usage pops and it does authentically express Sabrina's emotion. Lot of nice 70s musical references in this song

**Baelyana** (6.4): just fine

**FluffyNobody** (6.2): eh this is a bonus song for a reason. It's nice but it doesn't hold a candle to the main album

**FitzMarble** (6): like whatever, take some viagra

**jman457** (6): It feels like a bonus tracks

**krusso1105** (6): Very forgettable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): how the hell is a sabrina carpenter song with this title not a sexual innuendo

# **flaccid**

**Ambrosia42** (5.5): i feel like this just never leaves any impression on me. It’s fine

**oh\_crow** (5.5): these bonus tracks feel a bit like, more of the same but a little lower quality. i hope one of them is like really good and a bit weird or maybe a lot weird

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (5): Sidebar, but y'all really spared Sab by not including the Dolly collab lol. Anyway, I enjoy the music of this one and like how it sounds like early 60's country vintage vibes. Her vocals are amazing here, especially on the bridge. I don't enjoy the lyrics so much; themes wise, cool, but the double entendres have played out by this point in the album. So production yay; vocals yay; lyricism not so yay.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): you could make it easier to listen though…

**ktajlili** (5): this has beautiful vocals but that's about it

**vayyiqra** (5): Every time I see the word ""reactionary"" I think of its political meaning (ultra-conservative) and lol cursed

**wane them lietoc!** (5): NOT REALLY

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (4): I gotta wince every time someone misused the word reactionary when they mean reactive but also I’ve yet to like the use of fuckboys in songs. Ngl this album also reminds me of Rosie that it kinda just makes me sad and makes the singer come across as often sad to me.

**DirtyRat583** (4): oh there are a fair few dolly nachos i can taste in this recipe

**nooodisaster** (4): kinda snoozy

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this just veers a little too cheesy for me but it does have some of her most mature writing on the record

**fair-profile-8367** (3.5): I love how everyone expected this to be incredibly horny, and it was depressing instead

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.2): this is like a bad disney song with bad words

**blueberries929** (3): Yeah no

**kauai6** (3): a snoozer

**modulum83** (3): didn't expect her to randomly come out as a right winger here but ok

**pbk** (3): how is the innuendo queen gonna waste a title like this on a boring sincere ballad

**runaway3212** (2): girl you could not make it any slower either

**beeozan** (1.5): i thought this album was saying the opposite

**sfouou** (1): yawn

**bogo** (0): she couldn't make it any better either i guess

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (0): I dislike this for the same reason I dislike Sunset Blvd

# **Tell me more, tell me more, did you get very far? (no)**

**buildingigloos** (8): This is like if a modern pop star went back to the 50s and recorded a song, impeccable vibes. If Grease was made today, this would be on the soundtrack

**bigbigbee** (7.6): She sounds great in this song. The ex-musical theater kid jumped out. Giving Hopelessly Devoted To You from Grease.

**Able-Scene6741** (7): the title MUST be intentional also this is literally just hopelessly devoted to you

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7): Can you make a modern version of Hopelessly Devoted To You? Yes, I'll try to, she said. But to be fair, her voice sounds so good in this sonic environment and she could make a critically acclaimed doo-wop and acoustic pop songs.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Close enough welcome back Sabrina Carpenter Hopelessly Devoted to You cover

**implasdad** (6.7): nice enough. not as good as olivia newton john

**arboresca** (6.5): I see why this is on the deluxe but I also relate to this way too much, gives me hopelessly devoted to you vibes as well

**ConnerY2323** (6.5): this sandra dee moment

**daftsone** (6): Sounds like a rejected song from Grease

**akanewasright** (5): she tried real hard to reverse engineer “Hopelessly Devoted to You”

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): hello hopelessly devoted to u but worse

**Stryxen** (2): this blatant hopelessly devoted rip off helpppp saqueena taking what she deserves for being a queen iktr",3,2025-04-11 19:10:56

**camerinian** (7.5): why did i give this a 7.5 lol can you tell i did this score months ago, actually I kinda think this is so awkward and pays off so weirdly with the “moanin’ and bitchin’” line, I think the idea of a country campfire tune about the dating pool being shite is very funny on its face but the structure kinda isn't there

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): Her downtempo country serve!! This isn’t one I return to often, but I do enjoy myself when it plays! It has some of her cheekiest lyrics, and slandering men is always welcome in this household.

**impla77** (4.3): Lowkey I would’ve predicted this to get last place before the rate began but it narrowly misses the bottom five. I just… can’t find it in myself to care about this one. I LOVE to hear people moan and bitch but Sabrina, you’re boring me! Also the gay awakening line is such an eyeroll to me I fear. Still everyday is a learning lesson as now I know what the Grindr notification sounds like.

# **Country Bumpkins**

**emayzee** (10): if sabrina carpenter is complaining about the dating pool then what the fuck am i supposed to do

**FluffyNobody** (10): this was close to being my 11, I just love how desperately ironic she is, and how she lowers her standards from the first pre-chorus to the next and still can't find a guy

**wane them lietoc!** (10): If sabrina carpenter covered Bedhead's To the Ground the fucken indiesphere would self destruct. Sabrina Carpenter has that level of rizz to do it

**wathombe** (10): since this good song is so underrated, i'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.5): cuntry fierce cowboy boots diva barnhouse down

**uiscebeathaoir** (9.5): Fully betting my life savings rn that SC7 is a full on country album

**CrimsonROSET** (9): sometimes the dumb ones are a fun time sabrina you know this

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Sabrina Parton

**seanderlust** (9): her kacey musgraves bag here

**welcome2thejam** (9): Oh hell yeah baby she's ready to settle!!! That's my cue m'aam, I'm not jacked or kind but I'm present and at your service!!!

**blueberries929** (8.8): Used to think the pre-chorus was talking about a boy who's jacked and kind but has a really flat ass

**Ambrosia42** (8.4): spill it

**NervousLemon6670** (8.3): Love the verses here but the chorus throws the whole song off for me? It's good but something isn't clicking for me entirely into place

**beeozan** (8): at least shes honest

**darj** (8): being a stickler for grammar is very funny. okay I was a bit harsh earlier on some of Sabrina’s humor falling flat, but yeah when she’s on she’s on!

**implasdad** (8): i quite like the country theme on this one, dolly should have tried her hand here instead.

**skylofte2** (8): i do love to moan and bitch

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It’s not too late to have a gay awakening Sabrina!! I believe in you

**modulum83** (7.8): listen if sabrina doesn't want the himbos she can send them my way

**fair-profile-8367** (7.5): Incredibly underrated and gorgeous melody

**Soalai** (7.5): One of the funniest songs. Why is it so hard to find a guy who's 6'5"", blue eyes, with a trust fund?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): and i thought PPP was too country for me...

**arboresca** (7): although the Lord did not forget my gay awakening, I'll always be serving up some moanin' and bitchin'. this song is hilarious

**bigbigbee** (7): I like when she gets a little country with it

**daftsone** (7): Sounds like good honest country, but not quite executed to perfection

**donewithbirds** (7): you can reeeaalllyy hear the dolly influence on sabrina's vocal delivery here (complimentary). really don't know why this tends to be the lowest rated song on the album, it's cute!

**human\_performance** (7): Good use of slide guitar here. See Jack Antonoff ain't that bad y'all

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7): think I liked this more when she performed it a few times acoustically before the album released. for some reason it always makes me want to eat barbecue, but at a specific barbecue place in cooperstown. idk these are just the thoughts that pass right through me

**jman457** (7): cute little song, but nothing that goes above and beyond.

**nooodisaster** (7): Me writing a song about affordable housing:

**pig-serpent** (7): Sabrina, (I know you're reading this) if you're serious about all the good men being taken DM me. I have a lot of single, male friends who I'm fairly sure are good people and I'm more than willing to set you up on a blind date.

**Restless\_Dill16** (7): Not too crazy about this one, but I love hearing Sabrina Musgraves!

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): This one succeeds cause it’s corny and self-aware unlike the others

**Baelyana** (6.9): yeehaw

**nonchalantthoughts** (6.8): this is a choice…

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): something something jane wickline SNL bit",3,2025-04-11 19:40:06

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.7): Reheating nachos of a good song is encouraged in this household actually! A worse drivers license is still a good song!

**camerinian** (6): so yeah spoiler alert but this isn’t the only cut we’re losing today on the basis of (this is just hit single from previous album but worse), and uh it’s not like you guys are wrong necessarily

**impla77** (5): I think we have had a total of one song eliminated that wasn’t a ballad so far. Here is another one, and yet another song that I would have rated higher had I been forced to arbitrarily assign a score to this today. I would agree that at times this track really evokes ‘drivers license’ and can get tied down in comparisons to it. I like ‘drivers license’ so I guess I don’t mind that much but it’s definitely the track that feels like the sour era the most. Also… I hate to say it but there is discourse surrounding this track over who it is or is not about. There seems to be people on either side in the comments for this one so what I really want for you to do is fight 🙂(jk). Also I want to shout out nooodisaster’s 11 comment for this one! I love to see people talking so passionately about music and it definitely had a few points I hadn’t considered up till now.

---

# **Has my undying love**

**nooodisaster** (11): I could write an essay about how much I love this song. You know what.... ""The Grudge"", the 10th track in Olivia Rodrigo's sophomore album GUTS is both an exorcism and a surrender. From the opening lyrics, Rodrigo's hyper-specific details draw us into a universal feeling. ""I have nightmares each week about that Friday in May."" The best pop is like this, details that only the artist could write that conjure feelings that every person listening has experienced. Because every pre-teen has ""fantasized about a time you're a little fucking sorry"", even if that's to their parents for taking away their iPad. What complicates this song is that the context Olivia gives it is transient. At first listen, it sounds like a breakup song, a betraying lover, ""Your flowers filled with vitriol."" But stans do as stans do and put disparate pieces together: Olivia's formally outspoken support of her stated inspiration, Taylor Swift, now quiet. The public songwriting issue of ""Déjà Vu"" where Rodrigo post-release added Swift's team to the credits for ""inspiring"" the bridge. Lyrics like ""You have everything and still want more."" Is this song about a lost lover, or a lost idol? Either way, I don't think it dims the songs power. And that the song works on multiple levels just adds to its emotional and lyrical power, like similar dual meaning song ""we can't be friends"" by Ariana Grande. Sometimes, ambiguity doesn't diminish meaning, but enhances it. Up to this point, I could almost be describing a poem. But the sonic landscape of ""The Grudge"" is what makes it memorable, endlessly replayable, and the centerpiece of GUTS. As a power ballad, it's at once one of the simplest, softest tracks, and one of the most stunning. Rodrigo's voice sounds unedited, breaths and spit still audible. Her voice trembles, a hint of a choir just out of earshot, a laugh never taking off, a belt flatlining. ""It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong."" When the song ends, we're left at the same place. The bridge has swelled, she's screamed her pain, talked it through, and still... Doesn't feel any better. It's catharsis without resolution, anger with no purpose. It's pop perfection. It's human. AND I DIDN'T USE CHATGPT TO WRITE THIS SHIT EITHER!!!!!!

**Able-Scene6741** (10): would’ve been better if it was about the demon from the grudge movie😘

**curryraejepsen** (10): easily one of olivia's best ballads

**dreamingpastel** (10): The second 11 of the album!! I once said that this was one of Olivia's best, and I still stand by that fact.

**fair-profile-8367** (10): The line ""The arguments that I've won against you in my head"" is my far the most relatable lyrics I've ever heard

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): poet laureate realness

**jonathanadr13** (10): ugh love this one so much. the lyrics eatttt

**runaway3212** (10): I truly relate this song to an ex-friend and it's so powerful idk

**Straight-Meaning** (10): One of the two I would have given my top score to, I love this song so much

**emayzee** (9.6): i'll admit balladphobia got me upon release but i finally understood this greatness like 6 months later

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): Knowing it's about TS makes it so satisfying.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): ballad olivia will forever be classic

**wathombe** (9): great ballad that feels like it should have been on sour

**Soalai** (8.8): ""It takes strength to forgive but I don't feel strong,"" I mean what a lyric

**bogo** (8): do people still think there's some strange beef between olivia and taylor and that this song is about said beef because olivia isn't constantly bringing her up or being gal pals with a woman who's a decade older than her or have we all gained sanity and intelligence

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): Those cuts were never equal INDEED

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): It’s great but it’s also the only song on the album I’ve never had a period of obsessing over

**1998tweety** (7.5): ok but better than the other ballads

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7.5): Lyrically, this is the stronger ballad on the album. I feel like it got overshadowed by all the ~discourse~ surrounding it. But like... look, I'm not gonna say the theories DON'T track here...

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): people thinking this song is about Taylor Swift is so funny to me

**implasdad** (7.5): nice little ballad, nice bit of piano

**Baelyana** (7.1): taylor swift get up

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is not her best ballad and i dont love it a lot but i can tell its gonna get robbed kinda

**donewithbirds** (7): ""and we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal"" man what a line

**FluffyNobody** (7): this sounds like it could fit on sour, sonically and thematically

**human\_performance** (7): The strongest of these ballads melodically that I've listened to so far

**vayyiqra** (7): She showed a lot of maturity and growth over the last two songs huh.

**dys-fx-al** (6.5): i didn't love this on first listen but it has grown on me

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (6.5): like it's a nice ballad but when I think about the inspirations for it that have been mooted, it's like...girl. take it easy.

**wane them lietoc!** (6.5): again, im not eggsactly coming to o-rod for this but like yeah it bawps and you could put it in a super bowl ad",3,2025-04-11 20:02:32

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.7): Billie’s first out comes in at a respectable #33! Honestly I wish the first part was the entire song, the synths part is so otherworldly. The second part does remind me of stuff on HTE, so I do like it. But the intro to BLUE kinda makes this feel like an interlude and makes it unravel! Regardless, I don’t feel like this deserves the multiple 0’s that it got…

**camerinian** (7): it’s a shame that one of billie’s more ambitious tracks was her first out, but the comments really do reflect the general sentiment of HTE being such a high water mark for her multi-part tracks that everything coming later can’t help but pale if it doesn’t have that build, and I’ll admit the electroclash-y synth build on the first half does work a lot better for me than the watery dub of the middle section.

**impla77** (6.5): Oh hi Billie! You’re in this rate too! I find this song has a lot of missed potential for me. There are some ultra cool things going on here, one of my favourite moments in the album is the synths at the beginning which kinda sound like a synth version of an orchestra testing their instruments at the start of a performance. Then there’s the middle part where I really like the melody and the production but the lyrics seem like Billie’s phoning it in tbh. We then transition into a cool and atmospheric leadup into the final song in the album BLUE which makes me remember how much I fucking love synths. However, the transitions don’t work for me, and just leaves the song feeling disparate and not cohesive, just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest that this is Billie’s lowest song.

---

# **I CAN fall in love with you**

**innuendo\_overdose** (11): fascinating look into WWAFAWDWG minimalism refracted through large atmospheric tendencies and the most delicious synth tones this side of y2k, a real summination of what Billie Eilish was put in the landscape to achieve. multi-part techno(??) suite is the sort of thing I’m beyond ecstatic that has been made on a major pop release in 2024, so it gets the special score for being a song designed to appeal to a freak like me.

**FitzMarble** (10): whoa…. she got one of those charli xcx le creusets because this is pure cookery

**kauai6** (10): the production!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): AHHHH SYNTHS AAHHHHHHHH

**UselessTacooo** (10): doing my part to save this from day 1 (I will fail)

**buildingigloos** (9): it's giving me Happier Than Ever whereas the last song was way more When We All Fall Asleep vibes, it's a nice 3 songs to emulate which kind of encapsulate the progression of her career

**darj** (9): this album gets good towards the end okayyy. this one was a vibe

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (9): love the guitars

**IIIHenryIII** (9): she stole from Brazilian funk and she should be punished for it

**nooodisaster** (9): the intro is gooooregeeooousss. and the actual song is bossa nova 2.0 goodness. then, the outro?! (sorry this comment is so generic i need red bull)

**oh\_crow** (9): i just really appreciate the songs in the back half of this album that arent afraid to get a little weird with it!

**vayyiqra** (9): It would be too much of a gimmick if every song on this album had a beat switch, but, consider how good they all are.

**beeozan** (8.6): ok the switchup to this one rules although it was a bit too late

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i really wish the first part went longer before switching up this would've been such an easy 10. still easily one of the best on the album though

**Stryxen** (8.5): a serve

**ConnerY2323** (8.2): this stretch of the album is so french, she was really in her baguette

**implasdad** (8.1): another solid track from billie. i like the syncopated beat and the tempo change

**bogo** (8): this sounds like what the wii shop channel would sound like after it got shut down if it were an actual physical location

**donewithbirds** (8): the bass on the first section is DELICIOUS and i love some billie bossa nova but ngl my favorite part is the lead up into blue

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this album is legitimately no skips

**blueberries929** (7.7): No clue what she's talking about but it's a vibe

**arboresca** (7.5): the switch up! the parallels! the transition! stunning.

**krusso1105** (7.5): This is the one song on the album where I don't really like the mixing/production. The vocals sound kind of drowned out.

**Soalai** (7.5): I think I'm finding I like her electronic/harsher sounding songs more than her acoustic stuff. The production here is cool and really fits the album cover.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): i want to like all the callbacks during the kahoot breakdown more than i do but the first and last parts are the stuff that really clicks here

**Able-Scene6741** (7): I love it Everytime I listen to it but I’ve listened Atleast 20 times and I still can’t remember a second after it’s done playing this is an elusive anti-hook

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7): this is alright, but this is easily one of the album's shortest and weakest points, again. But the lead up to the final song is great and cool as fuck.

**Broshi** (7): ""Okay I don't really remember this part of the album""

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7): Perhaps the weakest moment on the album. The production is starting to blend together and there is nothing memorable about this song other than sounding good.

**jirachi** (7): i don’t know what is going on girl but i live

**Treecoh** (7): The transition into Blue is an 11 but the rest of the song is ehhhhh.

**emayzee** (6.9): she needs to stop doing these switchups on me bc i absolutely loved that first 90 seconds and then i just end up resenting that the rest of the song doesn't sound like that

**kerriekipje** (6.5): a 6 but it gets an extra 0.5 points for the outro

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): Little confused what this song is trying to do. It feels barely put together and like it’s floating in its own vibe. The outro saves it though.

**wathombe** (6.5): another multiple-songs-in-one track

**Baelyana** (6.2): alright let's get to blue",3,2025-04-11 20:19:11

**camerinian** (9): man i get the guitar jam fatigue on this album, but this one is so cute! it has the charm of someone just starting out and fucking around with their friends, but the production value of real pros, it's charming! Bad day 1 pick!

**impla77** (7.7): And yet another guitar driven, hoot and holler song goes out.. WHAT A COINCIDENCE! This works on a lot of levels for me.It’s very tongue in cheek, has personality in spades and is just a rollicking good time in my estimation. I don’t mind this genre of song, even though it’s maybe not what people are tuning in for in regards to a Sabrina Carpenter album but it just makes me smile. The nonchalant way in which she delivers these scathing lines is one of my favourite vocal deliveries on the album.  Docking some points due to it being a bit generic though. However it probably should’ve made day 2!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.2): A cute little ditty! Sabrina channels her inner Flannelpop core as she makes a song prime for campfire! Instead of the typical cutesy lyrics though, she went with scathing lyrics that ended Shawn Mendes… Not the first time he will be ended in a rate this month I guess.

—

# **Gatherin’ round the campfire**

**akanewasright** (10): the best country-inspired song on the album by a mile. That bridge is ROCK solid

**Awkward\_King** (10): my meowest of meow meows.... others dont understand you the way i do. get his ass!!!!!!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): YEEHAWPHOBIA BE GONE FROM THIS HOUSE

**CrimsonROSET** (10): those nananas tickle my brain

**darj** (10): who was listening to Rilo Kiley - With Arms Outstretched in the studio?!?!? https://youtu.be/-zTXFOUvZiw?si=qu_oS3gNF-qKnjg6

**emayzee** (10): the bridge to outro is one of my favorite moments of the album

**FluffyNobody** (10): I know many people despise the campfire vibes but she has so many good lines here! ""your car drove itself from LA to her thighs""? COME ON

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I thought this sounded so familiar but I couldn’t figure it out and then I saw a tiktok that said it was basically

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): the easiest 10 I’ve ever given ever. that acoustic guitar figure? are you kidding me? let it take me now. Sabrina 11

**RainbowSherbet47** (10): Coincidence? I THINK NOT

**runaway3212** (10): I fear I've been on the other side of this song a few times like OMG I've lost my keys and I have to immediately go to my exes house who has a spare key... Also I don't think it's working out between us

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): psychological warfare that violates the Geneva Convention

**wane them lietoc!** (10): when she just basically makes REM - Don't Go Back to Rockville in her own way that would've fit on sub pop anywhere 2009-2014, well what the fuck am I supposed to do?!

**ricki** (9.6): is holding space for defying gravity relevant enough to reference in a rate comment yet

**stealthamo** (9.5): I never expected a Sabrina Carpenter song to remind me of Crosby, Stills, & Nash, but here we are.

**wathombe** (9.5): great story, clever lyrics, and a little more acoustic/country vibe for wathombe

**modulum83** (9.3): she out-flannelcored everyone in flannelcore

**Frajer** (9): the Wicked lady didn't invent holding space huh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): once again, amazing melodies

**WesternWind** (9): Camila Cabello influencing everyone this march omg

**bogo** (8.5): i am not completely immune to the stomp clap hey agenda

**fair-profile-8367** (8.5): After every ""What a coincidence?"" I just picture Sabrina grinning like a madman.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): perfect song for a campire

**blueberries929** (8.4): underrated masterpiece

**Ambrosia42** (8.3): your car drove itself from LA to her thighs…this is why we don’t buy Teslas

**jman457** (8.3): Its such a simple yet effective guitar driven song, that feels so catchy in a folk vibe.

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.2): now this should have been a single!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): this is very Dodie/Emma Blackery

**Able-Scene6741** (8): I wonder what Camila thinks about this one

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (8): JONI MITCHELL REALNESS! Some of y'all need to get back in your campfire clap-along bags. Also some of her best lyricism on the album. I think this is a good example of how Sabrina really is a genre-hopper, and a good one at that.

**asadprofessorplum** (8): I am a passive agression enabler idc idc

**Catalyst** (8): she said holding space first wow shes so ahead of her time.

**daftsone** (8): Guitar on this one goes kinda hard

**donewithbirds** (8): yeah my 70s folk/country pop loving self eats this the hell up, who would have guessed

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): ""OH WOW YOU JUST BROKE UP AGAIN!!"" sorry I don't understand people who don't enjoy this song. it's got personality in spades

**letsallpoo** (8): this is the most olivia rodrigo-coded bridge in the rate

**Soalai** (8): One of my fave deep cuts that I hadn't heard before

**Stryxen** (8): this is such a CLOCK IT 😍

**UselessTacooo** (7.8): this guitar is simultaneously so annoying and so catchy

**qazz23** (7.5): liked the chorus vocals and country sound of this

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): A breezy, loose listen though the song isn’t anything special.

**ConnerY2323** (7.2): this holy bridge

**1998tweety** (7): the bridge eats but the rest is fine

**arboresca** (7): tear him apart, also, did Sabrina predict the ""holding space"" meme?

**Baelyana** (7): camila cabello get up

**human\_performance** (7): a country-inspired turn does fit Sabrina solidly

**nooodisaster** (7): Shawn Mendes needs to be studied bc how does one generic white boy make multiple GORGEOUS gorgeous women obsessed to the point of albums PLURAL written about him, as well as the entire gay population to the point they invent gay rumors to try to get with him.

**skylofte2** (7): a cute campfire bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): why does sabrina sound like shes about to make everybody at the bar get tipsy

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh this country girl",3,2025-04-11 20:29:03

**impla77** (7.7): welp another bonus track for Olivia out! I find this one pretty charming, even though the concept itself is pretty blah and played out. I really like the melody here, I don’t mind the strumming guitar and the lyrics are nice and evocative. I wouldn’t mind Olivia putting out some more singer-songwriter tracks like this one, but I am also more attached to the more pop-rock songs, we need someone to feel that niche! Still she can get her acoustic guitar out sometimes and I will be there for it (unless it comes in the form of girl i’ve always been).

**camerinian** (7): the only deluxe track here that really screams “deluxe track”, like completely fine on its own, nice even, but also if this never saw the light of day I don’t think we’d be so sad, and it just pales compared to the rest of the spilled hits

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): When I searched for this on Spotify, the Hillary Duff song showed up instead and I feel like that speaks volume to how much this song is loved… shout out to arboresca for your 11 comment though it really resonated with me!!

---

# **Wants to make friends with this song**

**arboresca** (11): this whole rate i've been trying to keep these pretty short & sweet (pun intended) but in the case of stranger i have to dump a little. basically, this song means the world to me. guts (spilled) came out during a really busy week for me, about two months after i was ghosted by someone i was in a really messy situationship with. that week was the very first time i finally had something else on my mind other than my ex, and it felt so good. i was driving home that friday night listening to guts (spilled) and cried to this song because it summed up everything i was feeling so perfectly. that week and this song are forever tied together for me, and they were the kickstarters for me to actually start healing and trying to move forward and i'm just forever grateful. i'm doing a lot better now, but even now, the bridge and final chorus still make me emotional. overall i just really, really love this song, and i'm not at all expecting it to go far but there's no way i could have done this rate and not given it my 11.

**Baelyana** (10): or this one.

**daftsone** (10): Predictable, but in the best possible way

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): REAL

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): oh Scared of My Guitar you’re ended IMMEDIATELY

**runaway3212** (10): This song gives me hope when I'm hung up about some exes

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): This sounds like a Dolly Parton song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I’m not too optimistic for this one because I know y’all HATE a good campfire singalong.

**modulum83** (9): i've gotten to this point recently after like.... a year or so and it genuinely feels a lot better. anyway excited to reopen the wounds again when i rate TTPD!

**Stryxen** (9): some brilliant lyrics and i love a little random acoustic moment, i think the pacing of the spilled tracklist works against these songs though

**Able-Scene6741** (8.5): sounds too similar to girl I’ve always been but it’s more enjoyable so I’ll pick a fav twin

**darj** (8.5): I am once again being baited to curate and host that blessed&cursed 2000s Sub Pop Indie Folk grab bag…not restraining myself to Sub Pop label only, 2000s Sub Pop Indie Folk is an intrinsic vibe, here’s how we are GETTING that Devendra Banhart rate win

**stealthamo** (8.4): Pro-tip: If you're stressing about something, just remember that somewhere down the road it won't even be an afterthought.

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): this is a pretty good ballad.

**Frajer** (8): one hundred times more Taylor nachos than Deja Vu

**WesternWind** (8): me talking about my father

**ConnerY2323** (7.9): what a cute surprise! folklivia showed up for a second

**Ambrosia42** (7.8): who

**implasdad** (7.8): its a nice song

**blueberries929** (7.6): Said it's raining but the sun's- wait wrong song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): i do think this is a sweet track

**wathombe** (7.5): this one never grabbed me, either, but it's got some good lyrics and builds nicely

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this song is about harry styles after he kidnapped-

**donewithbirds** (7): feels kind of early 2010s stomp holler but i don't hate it (i remember that era fondly there are TENS OF US)

**human\_performance** (7): Another country experiment that works a little better than the last one, 'girl i've always been', but country is not where she needs to go next

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (7): catch it jbass or whatever

**jirachi** (7): you literally said you were scared of your guitar...

**jman457** (7): A nice little track

**nooodisaster** (7): wholesome, i like this one

**ricki** (7): since everything is doing country now A CERTAIN POP STAR THAT HAD HER START IN THE GENRE SHOULD CONSIDER RELEASING THE RERECORDINGS TO HER DEBUT……. JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER

**Sad-Guidance9105** (7): the random folk moment

**Straight-Meaning** (7): same as guitar for me

**vayyiqra** (7): Olivia is true indie

**Soalai** (6.8): It's good when I'm actively playing it, but I can't remember it a while after it's over

**wane them lietoc!** (6.6): end of the day none of these bonus cuts are why im here to rate o-rod.

**krusso1105** (6.5): I barely remember this song despite listening to this album multiple times

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): she really thinks she is slick putting a song called ""stranger"" right next to a song with ""american"" in the title... we see your ethel stannage babe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): how funny i never considered myself tough",2,2025-04-11 20:11:12

**impla77** (10): Our last song of the day, and obviously it’s a ballad 🙁 So I LOVE this song btw. It would probably be my 11 if the GUTS bonus tracks weren’t included. There’s something so hypnotic about the melody, the harmonies are gorgeousss and the whole vibe is this slightly sinister sapphic soundscape. I’m so obsessed! Dare I say ROBBED?

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.7): This was safely Day 2 for most of the rate, but two late 0’s made it drop out at the late stages. In fact, this missed Day 2 by less than 1 point… and I would just like to say ROBBED!! It’s easily the best ballad on the album, with an amazing soundscape, and the harmonies??? hello?? Chappell’s backing vocals works so well with Olivia’s, better than on Can’t Catch Me Now in fact… This song is so good why this is day 1 would forever mystifies me!

**camerinian** (7.5): and here’s one that i regret not giving a higher score when we got the host ballots together, ohhhh this has wormed its way into my brain so hard, the sound palette is just so lush and it suits this emotionally torn attraction so well, the pairing is hypnotic, and again it’s such a shame it got hit with the balladphobia stick because there’s way more going on under the surface of just the keys

# **i feel your compliments like bullets on skin**

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): mmmmm… crushing on a straight girl

**FakeMonaLisa28** (10): One day I’m gonna write a lesbian horror story based off of this song

**innuendo\_overdose** (10): such a good melody, mmmmmmmmmmmm

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): i swear me and olivia experience jealousy the same way

**RandomHypnotica** (10): you wanna guess the color of my chappel roan backing vocals

**ricki** (10): world peace will be achieved when olivia and sabrina kiss on camera

**runaway3212** (10): LESBIANS LETS GOOOO LETS GO LESBIANS

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): oh the theories when this song was released

**emayzee** (9.6): honestly shocked that this doesn't seem to be a fan fav i love it so much

**UselessTacooo** (9.6): coming for chappell’s wlw nachos

**Able-Scene6741** (9.5): what a lovely lesbain lover letter- I mean totally straight hetero jealousy bop yes hehehe

**modulum83** (9.3): listen they dont call it the kinsey Scale for nothing

**daftsone** (9): Really nice ballad, damn near perfection

**donewithbirds** (9): hahahaha i can't relate to this at aaaaaallllll i've never had a jealous obsession with a girl that bordered on erotic longing nooooo not meeeeee

**krusso1105** (9): This is the gayest song a straight (I think) singer has written

**ktajlili** (9): Out of the several ballads of this album, Lacy truly stands out as the strongest, with specific lyrism and angelic vocals layered atop gorgeous instrumentals. If Lacy looks and acts as beautifully as this song sounds, she truly is an object of envy.

**pbk** (9): not to be a gaylivia but this gay ass song

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): This album wasn’t really doing it for me for a couple weeks after release, but once this song clicked for me everything else fell into place

**akanewasright** (8.5): idk I actually like this one

**arboresca** (8.5): to me personally this song is 100% a wlw anthem & that little instrumental interlude always makes me feel like I'm floating. also love that Olivia & Chappell both have Brigitte Bardot references in their songs.

**bespectacIed** (8): I'm a staunch balladlivia hater but this was the ONE ballad that made me tear up on the concert lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is kinda like that “Girl Crush” song from however many years ago if it slayed.

**buildingigloos** (8): how it feels to crush on a straight girl

**CrimsonROSET** (8): did you know this song was written about violet evergarden

**darj** (8): that ending

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): This is the strongest written track on the album imo, but suffers from being a boring ballad otherwise.

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): I really appreciate how she writes jealousy and how layered the song is.

**Frajer** (8): spanikopita skin still gives me the ick

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): envious poetry from USC…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me watching my favorite flash game themed digital horror youtube series

**welcome2thejam** (8): 👭?

**Baelyana** (7.9): have to be in a certain mood for this one

**ConnerY2323** (7.8): i grew up with like 12 girls with this name, all spelled differently, all bitches

**implasdad** (7.6): pleasant enough melodic song

**Brilliant-Primary500** (7.5): ouch, reminds me when I compare myself with the guys I hooked up and how they all look better, act more mature and kinder at everyone when compared to me.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): she def took an am I gay quiz

**wane them lietoc!** (7.5): IRON AND WINE HEADS STAND UP WE RISE TODAY

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (7.3): SUPER interesting sonic and tonal change here that adds some nice variety to the album. I love how her vocals are just slightly modulated, so its not distracting, but how it builds and gets more warped as the song goes on. Also an interesting lyrical perspective of reflecting on your obsession with a rival rather than making it all about the boy (as her first album tended to do)

**jman457** (7.3): a cute lil queer coded yearning song

**Soalai** (7.2): I'm so obsessed with your ex

**fair-profile-8367** (7): I will always love Olivia's pop songs, but her ballads showcase some of her best

**FluffyNobody** (7): I know I'm looking like a ballad hater in this rate when I'm a sad song girl at core, but this is just okay for me! lover the gay undertones though

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the harmonies are flawless

**kauai6** (7): boring but nice

**Stryxen** (7): melodies are so good but why does she sound like a creepy old woman

**vayyiqra** (7): Seeing a lot of Jolene type lyrical analysis but also a lot of takes saying they think it's about an eating disorder, or drugs even? Interesting I guess even if I don't quite see it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): We love ambiguous lesbianism (okay I don’t really care but I’m sure a lot of you do)

**NervousLemon6670** (6.9): Why are all the pop-girlies name-dropping Bridget Bardot these days?

**cinnamonpretzel1989** (6.8): this one is left more up to interpretation than a lot of Olivia’s songs, which I like",2,2025-04-11 20:44:48

**camerinian** (8): i love hearing sabrina dip into this smoky loungey rnb vibe, and I'm glad the consensus was on my side with this being a way stronger closer without the deluxe tracks

**impla77** (6.6): Oh I rated this a bit low sorry Sabrina heads! It’s definitely a very vibey track, and I have to agree with the consensus, this is a great closer. The dreamlike production really sells this one and kinda disguises how bitter some of these lyrics are lol. Honestly I would love an extended instrumental outro to really wallow in this melancholy vibe but yes I really dig this now.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): Why did I give this song a 4… Locking scores in before the rate gets posted is bad actually! This is a slow, sultry jam that I have overlooked before but trust I will be paying attention to now! Her Men I Trust serve..

# **Appropriately solemn**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuuuuuck………….FUCK!

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (11): this is how you end an album!! she was so confident that she made an impression, and then she realizes she might have to beg just to be remembered. melancholy masterpiece

**pbk** (11): this smash hit subversive midtempo sexy jam idk im so bad at explaining why i love songs but this song is just perfection for me

**buildingigloos** (10): The dreamy floaty sound combined with the lyrics is like when you have a really deep sleep after crying. It sounds like how loneliness feels, like the sadness is familiar so it's kinda comforting? Or when you've cried so much you're just numb and dissociative and drained

**fair-profile-8367** (10): Starting with 'Taste' and ending the standard version with 'Don't Smile' is genius!

**kauai6** (10): i love me some dream pop

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this would fit PERFECTLY on The Loveliest Time

**Stryxen** (10): men i trust weren’t releasing so she did it herself


**WesternWind** (10): me when I see someone much happier than me

**innuendo\_overdose** (9.7): this is her trip hop cut (feel free to ignore this comment if you actually know what trip hop is)

**modulum83** (9.5): yoooooo she's on her hypnagogic shit again

**1998tweety** (9): gagged

**beeozan** (9): what if she used some more vocal filters and made an album full of eccojams

**daftsone** (9): Kind of wish Sabrina would do songs like this more often, she can really sell this kind of vibe

**goodbyesindisguise** (9): perfect closing song and reaaaally makes me wish she’ll explore this sound a bit more on her next album. Such a vibe

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): idk what everyone is smoking i always thought this was a great closer

**wathombe** (9): fantastic bluesy track to wrap up the standard

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): real

**Brilliant-Primary500** (8): i like the way that this switched the ""don't cry, smile because it's over"" into ""don't smile, cry because it's over"". But like it's the only thing unique to this song other than that it'll an alright song.

**donewithbirds** (8): something i really respect about sabrina's songwriting is how unafraid she is to come across as petty or callous or desperate. wanting your ex to miss you as a mark that you and your relationship were important, that losing you left a hole, that it's been as hard or harder for them than it has been for you-- oof. real.

**flava** (8): okay the multi-tracking is very pretty

**Frajer** (8): I have rbf challenge accepted

**IIIHenryIII** (8): me when Rodrighoes lose:

**jirachi** (8): katy perry after her 5th album flopped:

**ruhroh386** (8): Lead single on Now That’s What I Call Songs to Trance To

**Sad-Guidance9105** (8): Beautiful inversion

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): Don’t like the lyrics at all but it does sound nice

**vayyiqra** (8): I think I kind of want Sabrina to make an album of all lofi R&B, don't ask

**Ambrosia42** (7.7): she wants him to have no peace in his life. A relatable feeling

**Able-Scene6741** (7.5): love the chill vegas vibe but it’s too short to get an 8 :(

**blueberries929** (7.5): This song as a whole is fine but the second verse... oh the second verse...

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7.5): got too repetitive but I do like the song and I enjoy a cynic spin to a saying now and then

**implasdad** (7.3): nice mellow vibe that makes me smile

**Awkward\_King** (7): pleasant closing track and love the way it flips the phrase on its head. perfectly tongue in cheek for sabrina. just has never been a song i've sought out on its own.

**bespectacIed** (7): cheesy lyrics aside this is pretty

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ok :(

**dys-fx-al** (7): I agree completely with her on this

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i associate “don’t cry because its over, smile because it happened” with a calendar my mom had in like 2008

**ricki** (7): https://tenor.com/view/loled-serioused-emoji-silly-emoji-smile-serious-emoji-gif-7374446469048077031

**skylofte2** (7): this melody ugh :wendybop:

**UselessTacooo** (7): Kali Uchis who?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s a cute ending I guess

**welcome2thejam** (7): 2:30pm festival pop rock band that keeps getting described as ""spacey"" kinda vibe

**ConnerY2323** (6.8): honestly grateful that this is just boring after some of the things i heard in this last run of songs

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): low fi beats to do homework to

**jman457** (6.8): A good vocal but its kind of boring as a closer.

**arboresca** (6.5): love the callback to Taste, feels very full circle

# **The Joker**

**FluffyNobody** (6): this for me is the low point of the album, but being the closer i can just skip it

**Restless\_Dill16** (6): Not a fan of this one, but I like how it circles back to Taste. I like to that song is just an angry post-breakup fantasy while this song is reality sinking in.

**runaway3212** (6): evil misogynistic men (... I guess good misogynistic men?)

**Soalai** (6): Kind of a yawn for a closing track

**TiltControls** (6): I always forget this is on the actual album and wasn't just thrown on a few months ago

**bigbigbee** (5.5): Just like Lie To Girls, I think the lyrics of this get boring and repetitive but it's pleasant to listen to

**team\_kockroach** (5.5): Would work better as an interlude than a fully-fleshed out song.

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (5): I like that it returns to the sort of shimmery 80's production, but otherwise it's pretty sleepy to me. In my opinion, ""Lie To Girls"" deserved to be album closer. Alas.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): Too repetitive

**nonchalantthoughts** (5): oh it’s that song! i don’t really care for this except for the bridge

**oh\_crow** (5): i dont know why but i wanted this production to have more bite. like it perfectly suits the song but i feel like it could have done with a groove that'd get me swaying in my seat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐

**qazz23** (4): a ☹️ way to end the album

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.1): whisper sing again and much reverb for a dreary time

**nooodisaster** (3): isnt that the plot of that one horror movie?

**pig-serpent** (3): Don't cry because you're listening to this, smile because the skip button is right there.

**Lynflower680** (10): Damn hippies

**Catalyst** (9): oh end his ass

**FluffyNobody** (9): insert interview of Shawn Mendez by John Meyer

**Frajer** (9): who's jacking off to ""they sentenced me to 20 years of boredom for trying to change the system from within""

**wathombe** (9): not quite as good as ""lie to girls,"" but a similar lyrical indictment of american manhood

**Ambrosia42** (8): This song gives me that type of pretentious guy that is loud about how he’s a feminist and loud about his unique and cool tastes, but he is actually just an asshole

**CrimsonROSET** (8): maybe men discovering self help was a mistake

**FakeMonaLisa28** (8): unfortunately I would fall for the exact kind of guy that this song describes

**jimmyrollinsdurag** (8): the duality of man exemplified in this coming after ""espresso"" but fr reading in her vogue cover story that this was the 2nd song she wrote for the album after ""espresso"" fascinates me. her contempt for the guy drips off every word

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): This does not deserve it’s inevitable last place

**implasdad** (7.7): pleasant enough

**blueberries929** (7.5): underrated masterpiece

**jman457** (7.5): Love the lyrics, wish the instrumentation was a little angrier though

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): vocals do carry but it ended up having alot of replay value for me

**asadprofessorplum** (7.1): I’m 17 and AFRAID of Sabrina Carpenter writing a song about me.

**buildingigloos** (7): This is what Taylor sounds like to me, it's like she's doing a Taylor impression

**daftsone** (7): Sounds like a lot of different people, none of them Sabrina, but it’s still good

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): is it defamation I think this is obvious about a famous Canadian lol. I do think the “you’d make a great wife” is a weird line and I kinda wish straight women in general would think more about why and how they also use women or being “like” a woman as an insult.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): slow & kinda boring

**nooodisaster** (7): ChatGPT when I tell it to ignore all prompts and write a haiku about eggs:

**ricki** (7): if olivia rodrigo had released this people would have said it’s taylor swift shade

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sabrina… have you considered NOT fucking the dumbasses?

**Baelyana** (6.7): good ballad. wish sabrina would show off vocally more sometimes

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): more like droll & poo shit

**arboresca** (6.5): not the best ballad on this album but honestly I love getting to really hear her show off vocally

**emayzee** (6.5): i like the lyrics but wish it weren't so boring

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): needs more of a build but I know exactly the man she’s dragging

**Brilliant-Primary500** (6): meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh and you can't blame me. This isn't my favorite song at all and it'll never be.

**donewithbirds** (6): eh i think there are better songs about this kind of guy (every taylor song about jack gyllenhaal, for example) and it's too short. good vocal performance from sabrina, though

**jirachi** (6): more like boring & slop

**Soalai** (6): It's fine but not memorable compared to the other stuff here

# **Rupi Kaur**

**modulum83** (5): why does every pop girl have to have a song about this now I DON'T CARE THAT YOU DATED A LETTERBOXD BOY THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM

**skylofte2** (5): forgettable i fear

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (4): When I first listened to the album, I loved this song for its acoustic breather and wanted it to be longer. Now, I'm pretty neutral on it. ""Just cause you leave like one doesn't make you a man"" eats though.

**flava** (4): :jirachidumb:

**pbk** (4): songs like this remind me of how painfully heterosexual this woman is

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.5): audible vocal attempt here but nothing hitting along with taylor esq sound not quite up to taylor level

**oh\_crow** (3.5): its just a nothing song to me, like inoffensive of course but so 'in one ear out the other' that i cant find something good to say about it

**akanewasright** (3): This is where the album sorta falls off a little for me

**bespectacIed** (3): bland & lethargic

**DirtyRat583** (3): ballad tankage #shocking

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I defend a LOT of her ballads (because most of them are good), but I can’t bring myself to gaf here. At least it’s short!

**ConnerY2323** (2): beyond the obvious worst part this is just incomplete

**fair-profile-8367** (2): ""You'd make a great wife"" is by far the most brutal line on this album

**UselessTacooo** (2): naptime!

**vayyiqra** (7): As a Canadian the Leonard Cohen line was even more !?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): we do kind of need to talk more about how bad a decision it was for shawn to end his last album on a fucking hallelujah cover and act like there is ANYTHING left to do with hallelujah by leonard cohen that hasn’t been done a dozen time

**seanderlust** (6): ""jacking off to leonard cohen lyrics"" close enough welcome back Ur So Gay by Katy Perry

**welcome2thejam** (6): The ghost of Leonard Cohen like ""What she say fuck me for?""

**WesternWind** (6): oh! who listens to the hallelujah man anyways these days, that's a red flag, dump him!

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I was so so obsessed with this song when the album came out and then I realized ""2+2=5"" is a really stupid lyric.

**blueberries929** (8): ""Two plus two equals five"" Lyricist of a generation

**jirachi** (8): erm it's actually 4 dumbass

**WesternWind** (7): yes its illogical she says 2+2=5, but as a math major I’ll allow it

**wane them lietoc!** (6.9): i mean this is like the second one of these that are nice stretch breaks but this isn't eggsactly why im coming to O-Rod, even though the chorus is such a gobble of phrasing (CHEW PLUS CHEW EQUALS F'HIVE) that got me belting w/her

**indie\_fan\_** (6.8): i know people boutta blame julia for the 2+2 line, but i could still see olivia being just as capable of writing that

**RainbowSherbet47** (6): The two plus two equals five part caught me off guard so I got a good laugh out of it

**Brilliant-Primary500** (5): two plus two equals the score that I'll give to this song because it's so boring.

**goodbyesindisguise** (5): u got me thinking 2+2=5

**qazz23** (5): = 2 + 2

**Baelyana** (4): oh god i replaced this one in my edited version of the album but 2 + 2 equals 5 is an awful line

**ImADudeDuh** (3): 2+2=6 and let me tell you why it was six, because look at this, there are two twos, so therefore there is an additional two that no one talks about BECAUSE THE GOVERNME

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i want this to be my meow meow but i do kind of not like it. oh 2+2 is 5?? what an original concept

**UselessTacooo** (2): everyone knows 2+2=fish girl try again next time

**Able-Scene6741** (6): Dolly remix when…

**buildingigloos** (6): Feels very Dolly Parton imo

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): Out of all the ballads on the album I like this one the most, but it's literally slim pickins here. Deducted a point for the lame ""gay awakening"" line too.

**oh\_crow** (6): i think its really smart of her to incorporate other genres into her oeuvre, and i think she has a lovely voice for country! i hope she takes it in a cool direction

**slimboyfriend** (6): peep the slide guitar

**team\_kockroach** (6): Antonoff’s finger-plucked guitars are great on this. Not as much of a fan of Sabrina’s vocal runs though.

**WesternWind** (6): girl just go country at this point!

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): wait we kind of need a sabrina cover of goodbye earl urgently

**bespectacIed** (5): sabrina pls this ain't texas

**Brilliant-Primary500** (5): too much country, not much else substance otherwise. MEH

**ConnerY2323** (5): she saw kacey’s nachos were on sale and placed an order after the kitchen had already closed

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): I truly think Sabrina has good country song in her

**DraculaWeekend** (5): Why did I not realize this was a country album

**kauai6** (5): the chorus is too empty for me

**runaway3212** (5): her picking out the bsides for this album

**TheQueenofVultures** (5): ""country girls make do"" ass song

**vayyiqra** (5): What is with all the acoustic on this album, this is literally a country song. I don't hate it, but ?

**dys-fx-al** (4.5): the country is country-ing but that's also the problem for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): well what we really need is a…femininoninon!

**asadprofessorplum** (4): Notice how she’s so done with men but won’t stoop to queerbaiting? Exactly exactly.

**bogo** (4): nauseatingly heterosexual

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i kinda hate the “slIiIIiiIim pickins” part

**jirachi** (4): I had a dream where I was being chased by non binary barista Sabrina Carpenter (i don't know why they were a non binary barista they just happened to be that) and this was playing in the background and it turned out that I fell asleep with this song blasting in my headphones and it was playing while i was in deep sleep.

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.2): very country pop similar to ppp

**goodbyesindisguise** (3): something about this song just does not do it for me… but I can appreciate her humor

**hikk** (3): i'm sorrrrry i can't stand when she countrifies it like it's just so BORINGGGGG

**pbk** (3): she should try being more like olivia and be scared of her guitar

**qazz23** (3): the other country sounding one was way better

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (2): Major skip for me I am sorry to say. I like the conceit of the lyrics, and it has fun moments, but the production bothers me. It feels so like... muted? But not intentionally, as if it was mixed horribly. But it is intentional, so blah.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): my only skip on this album. it just... does nothing. don't like the production, melody or the way she's singing.

# **Sabrina knows what you are**

**1998tweety** (10): oh she ate with that Grindr notification sound

**flava** (8): 15 minutes on grindr and i would considering settling for a guy who cannot tell the difference between there, their and they are

**ricki** (8): possibly sampling the grindr notification sound when she says “gay awakening” is gay pandering to a level only matched by the f5 social media team

**UselessTacooo** (8): the Grindr notification is so fucking funny

**oh\_crow** (5.5): i knew there'd be a few dull af ballads in here i know you olivia i know you!!

**pbk** (5.5): this sour song (/neutral)

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): no you get TWO ballads and replace one of the others with Obsessed, Olivia

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): ballad phobia on my part despite the fact I would love to know who the song is about lol

**asadprofessorplum** (4.5): Cindy the TV’s leaking

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): this has definitely worked its way to being one of my favourite ballads on the album but still doesn't really leave a mark in my mind. essentially it grew from i dislike it to im fine w it

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4.4): too much story telling overshadowing sonics

**akanewasright** (4): oh wait I forgot this one exists lol

**team\_kockroach** (3.5): Weakest ballad on the album. I’m a little tired of teary and pained adult-contemporary, even though Nigro does his best with this instrumental.

**pig-serpent** (3): This song may be named after a horror movie, but don't get confused. The only thing scary about it is how boring it is.

**qazz23** (3): don't care for this ballad

**beeozan** (2): leave behind your grudge. bring on the grunge

**kauai6** (2): the cursing does not work

**IIIHenryIII** (1): anyone who says this song is about Taylor, they’re delusional. Olivia wasn't having arguments with Taylor in the shower

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is just drivers license pt 2 but drivers license ATE so

**arboresca** (8.5): got my driver's license last week! despite the sonic similarities this is my favorite ballad on the album. this song used to make me cry, the vocals again have so much emotion.

**modulum83** (7.7): this one sounding like she wanted to get her drivers license renewed

**UselessTacooo** (6): drivers license at home

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): You can tell this is about Taylor Swift because in tribute to her she reused her old song and also made her lyrics worse

**Brilliant-Primary500** (4.5): ""Can you make Driver's License again? Yes, I will."" BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): she found the crumbs of 2 year old drivers license nachos in the cracks of her couch and tried her damndest to reheat them to no avail

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (6): I LOVE the opening of this track with the stadium electric guitar sound. I wish it carried through the entire song rather than doing another switch up.

**asadprofessorplum** (6): Wii music core

**bespectacIed** (6): first minute was a 10, hated the switchup

**bigbigbee** (6): how can you start the song like that and then switch it up? I admire that this song has parts to it, but I only like the head and the butt part and deeply want to skip when I'm in the middle bit

**CrimsonROSET** (6): was finneas just trying out soundboard pro

**dys-fx-al** (6): the beginning of this reminds me of those old spotify ads. i love the end of it + transition into the next one

**FluffyNobody** (6): eh again this does nothing for me, the outro is interesting but overall the song is a bit too monotone

**ricki** (6): why is naevis calling

**skylofte2** (6): some of these songs are wicked long

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): oh she wanted that rym bold BADLY

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Okay?

**jman457** (5): it dragged a lot

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): second half deeply outsold. but also cant touch any of the double songs on HTE

**RandomHypnotica** (4.2): ""lets make Happier Than Ever again but the first part is an actually good song and the second half sucks""

**pbk** (4): this was boring before the beat switch and then after the beat switch it was boring in a different way and then after the other beat switch it was just kinda loud

**wane them lietoc!** (4): this cut is swagless but honest

**Ambrosia42** (0): something about this is really not my vibe i fear… it sort of got more unpleasant as it went along

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (0): low effort whispering to provide the least engagement possible just above

**modulum83** (0): irrational hate 0 for a song that exemplifies every quality that i both love and hate about this album. this is a song that is essentially entirely beat switches. but also these beat switches sound fucking incredible! this album is filled with ambitious, thoughtful production and sound design, stuff that feels so alien and strange compared to most pop albums, and every tantalizing idea from the industrial synth intro to the random dub part to the ghostly intro to ""blue"" is actively trying to fool you into thinking this is a more interesting album than it actually is. because while you can go ""holy shit"" to any of these sounds and melodies as they're happening, it should not be that it leaves your head the moment the song ends. where are we going? what's the big idea? what are we doing here? stop fucking edging me! if MORE of the album sounded like this i might like it more!

**Brilliant-Primary500** (6): what a coincidence, it's as good as the previous song, but that ""from LA to her thighs"" is funny, I must admit.

**buildingigloos** (6): Probably the weakest on the album for me but it's still fun!

**pbk** (6): i dont really care for countrybrina but this one makes it work i think

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): somehow the most Bleachers song on this album has nothing to do with Jack

**beeozan** (5.4): the triangle bit is nice. but (and i cant believe im saying this) there is a lalalala song that's soft rocky done much better in another rate this month by Harry styles of all people

**implasdad** (5.4): bit aimless, very generic guitars

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): ZZzzzzzz....

**Dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): I knew her being an unwitting third part to another love triangle was a part of this short album but I did not expect to be so many songs and this is not as funny or entertaining as Camila clearly using Sabrina as a style guide during this unfortunately

**jirachi** (5): i can’t believe sabrina invented holding space omg

**Sad-Guidance9105** (5): Sounds like a song people sing around a campfire but in a bad way

**vayyiqra** (4): All the acoustic guitar in this album is weirding me out, I thought it'd be a lot more synthy. The ending literally reminded me of Judy Blue Eyes (it's a really old song, nvm. folk, 1960s).

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (3.7): usual guitar song fine for folk pop digesters

**sfouou** (3.5): not a fan of the slap clap percussion. ""your car drove itself from la to her thighs""??

**kauai6** (3): it feels…. unpolished and rough around the edges. feels more like something i would see a b-list country girl release rather than sabrina, a shame

**FluffyNobody** (6): this is also very country-tinged, weird that she left all of them off the main album - also weird that they're both self-written. then again, it's weaker than almost all the songs on main

**qazz23** (6): a decent hook on this

**skylofte2** (6): this is bordering on lumineers boom clap stomp shite... watch yourself olivia

**asadprofessorplum** (5.3): Please don’t ever become a stranger whose laugh I can recognize anywhere.

**Awkward\_King** (5): ""youre just a stranger i know everything about"" is a line that kind of hits me in the chest for complicated reasons. but also this song kinda just happens

**IIIHenryIII** (5): throw it back in the vault

**team\_kockroach** (5): This song sounds nice and healing but I don’t think I have any personal use for it.

**UselessTacooo** (5): way too sour-coded for me

**ambitiousbulbasaur** (4.8): Least memorable of the bonus tracks for me. I can also see this being something she wrote for Lucy Gray but it got scrapped. Definitely more of a deluxe track than needed to be on the base album. Actually, I don't think any of the bonus tracks NEEDED a place on the standard (which is honestly a good thing).

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): hopefully this is the last gasp of Disney leaving her body

**pbk** (4): if this was called strangers and it was about cannibalism it'd be an 11 btw

**Straight-Meaning** (5): probably my least favorite off the project, it just hasn’t stuck with me that much

**M\_INENT (reddit), charlibratfammanfanstan / eminentone (discord)** (4.6): tolerable whisper chorus from olivia and p good but lyrics left lot to be desired as rest of track

**1998tweety** (4): i give it an extra point for being gay but its sadly a snooze

**indie\_fan\_** (4): these asmr verses

**team\_kockroach** (4): I like how lush Nigro made this. But this song waters down the best parts of Vampire (or Traitor from her first album), and I wish Olivia would stop making dreary, plodding songs like these.

**jirachi** (3): sure grandma let's get you to bed

**jackisboredtoday** (0): how is the a team miles better at being a song that uses the really bad “skin like pastry” metaphor

When you watch her perform…it’s so bad that it reminds me of no one. I know she sites Stevie Nicks as an inspiration but I’m like….where? 🤣🤣 There is nothing comparable to Stevie. Taylor is just this tall person clomping around fake playing instruments and squawking into her microphone when she isn’t lip synching.

If another artist uses a guitar, that’s “Taylor’s influence,” —but I actually don’t see anyone intentionally seeking to replicate her.

Without all the marketing, Taylor doesn’t have anything unique about her that one could associate with strictly her, to even replicate. She writes songs lamenting about her love life, self-victimization or playing the villain.

Short N Sweet is an album about multiple guys, some from years ago (Hi Jake Gyllenhaal), made her current bf sound like he's only good for sex but also a total idiot (touch me while your bros...you know how to ball...), and had Jack Antonoff's fingerprints, which for now is fine but will get stale if she continues to work with him years into the future.

>I also don’t think there’s anything wrong or bad about Olivia’s “obsessed” song.

I wouldn't say wrong or bad either, but Olivia is still a new artist. She only has two albums. If you go by Taylor's first two albums, no one had any idea what she would've become. Now I agree Obsessed isn't ""Better Than Revenge"" or ""Pictures To Burn"" levels of *what the fuck*, it's just this ""I'm obsessive and crazy"" tone that rubs me the wrong way because it could be used in future albums if she chooses to make songs about an ex from years ago. Again, I don't think she'll follow in Taylor's footsteps and start singing about Louis in 2029 if they were to break up now.

To her credit, Olivia has more awareness in her early 20s than Taylor in her mid-30s. And she's been with Louis for over a year, which would've given 22 year old Taylor a panic attack.",8,2025-04-09 22:12:02

I've said this before, but if Taylor had written You Oughta Know, she would want everyone to it was about Dave Coulier. She would've talked about his blonde hair and drop a not so subtle reference about Full House. Look at the lyrics to All Too Well.

I've seen a few comments and I'm not sure how I gave the impression I hate break up songs. I mentioned Adele and Brooks & Dunne.  I just think A) there's a shelf life. Why would you write about someone you dated for a short period and were never married to/had kids 2+ years after the break up and WHILE you're in a new relationship? At least be single if you're going to spend your energy focused on someone else. I don't have an issue with TTPD because the Joe and Matty stuff was recent, but I know in my gut she's not done with Joe and Matty and Jake. B) If an artist must make a devaluation track (Fuck You by Cee Lo Green; You Oughta Know; Before He Cheats) it's shitty to use the song to point the listeners towards the direction of the muse.

Yes, it was the ""Bad Blood"" of the early 00s (not in scope; the music video was like a proto Shake It Off). She made the song because Courtney called her a cheerleader. It was petty and immature and brought attention to a person who was looking for attention.

So 35 year old Gwen Stefani dressed up as a chola, surrounded herself with a harajuku squad, and filmed a music video at a High School, and the song rightfully received mixed reviews. It was cringe, and she's too talented to be doing that shit.

I think if Pop Artists want to do diss tracks about other artists, they should at least follow what hip hop artists do and have the courage to name the person.

I'm just tired of the oversaturation of certain types of content, which were made popular by Taylor and is in my opinion, not healthy for young listeners. Taylor doesn't make uplifting music. Taylor doesn't make powerful music like Beyonce or Sia. She doesn't make badass music like Pink.

I don't mind break up songs, but not every ex is a piece of shit. Not every ex did you wrong. Not every ex needs to be told to go fuck themselves. Exes don't need to be stalked or harassed, and I'm surprised Jake never gave her a cease and desist. If someone is still thinking about the guy they dated for 6 months 2+ years after the break up, they need professional help. Holding grudges and being stuck in the past isn't healthy and I hate seeing a mentality like that be normalized. 

I've said this before, but she regressed from her first albums. *The Outside* showed introspection. *Back To December* showed maturity. TTPD sounds like it was written by a teenager with access to a thesaurus and who thinks name dropping poets will trick people into thinking she's well read.

She needs a writer. She needs someone who can take her outside of herself, because Taylor thinks the mundane details of her life are interesting and must be shared with the world. She isn't making music, she's publishing her diaries. There is a difference between telling personal stories with a melody, and sing-talking an account of something with extraneous detail that ruins the flow of lyrics, especially something that isn't that interesting.

I don’t know if she’s shared the backstory of the song - is it 100% autobiographical, 100% made-up, or somewhere in between? And I believe she wrote it with St. Vincent, so she might not have written all of the lyrics or come up with the concept. I will be disappointed if she goes down a victim-playing route, but I don’t see any clear signs of it yet.",12,2025-04-10 02:14:32
Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1jv86sb,I hate that Taylor has inspired other artists,mmbhy1s,InnocenceofaLion,"I understand what you’re saying, but a lot of songwriters have written about bad relationship experiences (romantic, friend, family). Taylor didn’t invent that, and people should be able to write about negative experiences. We don’t even know who Vampire is about. Taylor is obsessed with people knowing who she’s singing about. And out of over 200 songs that she’s written/co-written, how many admit flaws about herself and not in a narcissistic way or in a way in which it’s obvious that she doesn’t believe she’s the problem? Olivia admits she’s imperfect in several songs, and she takes accountability for her choices in “Making the Bed.”

The one song of Olivia’s that bothers me is Traitor. Saying that an ex-boyfriend is a traitor because he went on to have another relationship after theirs ended is crazy to me. I get that two weeks isn’t a long time, but she was only 17-ish. It’s not like they were in a 10 year marriage. But she was young then, so hopefully she has or soon will mature some.",13,2025-04-10 01:52:29

My momma and daddy were HUGE Fleetwood Mac fans. Even when I was still a Taylor fan, I didn’t like the idea of Taylor getting her grubby paws near Stevie. I think it’s such shit she included a poem written to her by Stevie in the TTPD cd insert. I’m sure she asked her if she could put it there, but I really just loathe how she has to have a hand in literally everything and constantly brag about her ultra famous “friends” when they’re literally just business relationships.",11,2025-04-10 01:28:01

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1jv86sb,I hate that Taylor has inspired other artists,mmcaaui,SpiritualAd9102,"I agree Olivia is better. She has more genuine and introspective songs, especially on Guts. I listen to her often and even went to her tour. But I remember when Vampire came out and it was very Taylor-esque with the fanbase frantically guessing who it was about. I even remember people settling on it being about some infamous celebrity moocher in LA, but I don’t remember their name. 

But Sour was very Taylor-coded. It went beyond singing about relationships, it was well known that she was singing about Joshua Bassett. Then her fanbase ran harassment campaigns against him to the point where he became extremely stressed, which contributed to a heart condition that almost killed him. Then when asked about it, she only came to Sabrina Carpenter’s defense and never said anything to get her fanbase to leave him alone. In his rebuttal song that he wrote much later, he even details how he felt she didn’t stop it because it was helping her career. 

So despite liking her, I’ve always side eye’d her a bit. I’m glad you mentioned Traitor because I hate that song for the same reason you said. You can’t vilify someone for moving on faster than you, especially when she broke up with him if you believe his version.",4,2025-04-10 05:10:59

A lot of people do know it's about Courtney though. I'd argue most people do. Anyone who looks up the song on Wikipedia or Genius learns about it.

It was a feud they had which became elevated. All over a generic insult. It made Courtney relevant for a time.

I think if someone is going to spend their time and money writing and recording a song meant to publicly diss someone, then just go full *Not Like Us* mode instead of doing the Drake sneak diss thing. But to each their own. That's just my opinion.",1,2025-04-10 02:44:22

So even people I know who don’t follow music kind of lump much of the criticism she gets as being from sexist trolls. Hell, I probably would’ve fallen in that camp like five or so years ago as someone who just listened to music and didn’t follow any news. I never liked how her fans harassed her exes and how she didn’t do anything to stop it, but I always sided on thinking she was free to make music around her personal experiences, not fully realizing how much damage she was willfully doing or other controversies like her Look what you Made Me Do music video. 

I think my personal awakening was the Grammy’s last year. Winning with such a mid album combined with a commercial lined up to advertise TTPD immediately after her win and her antics with Celine and Boygenius backstage made me detest her. TTPD itself, especially Thank You Aimee and people pretending its horrible lyrics were works of art, further solidified it.",1,2025-04-10 22:36:45

Correction: the lyrics for 1sf3sb are: “And I’d leave you, but the **rollercoaster’s** all I’ve ever had”

You can hear it in the song and see it in the lyric video. It is not “rollercoaster is,” it is “rollercoaster’s,” despite what comes up from a google search.

Interestingly enough, the lyric video only says “I ever had” instead of “I’ve ever had,” though she definitely says “I’ve” and not just “I.”",3,2025-04-04 22:48:43

Plus, the interviewer was Asian, making the lack of self-awareness even worse.

If you're truly passionate about playing metal, keep at it so you don't lose it; when you're older you'll be grateful when you're able to travel around a bit and find them.

Metal is one of those polarising genres and as you mention, statistically it's less popular than it is popular. It wouldn't hurt to branch out your genres without giving up playing metal.

Others not liking isn’t your concern, you can never make everyone happy, and if you try to do it, you’ll end up unhappy yourself at some point 


If you wanna show your friends/family metal bands, start with bands with no screaming or harsh vocals 

Disturbed, A7X, Sleep Token(maybe) 
Deftones(song without harsh vocals) 
Sevendust, Metallica, and maybe something like Linkin Park, Korn or Katatonia.

I mostly like the black Dahlia murder, shadow of intent, as blood runs black. Lots of real fast stuff. Nobody at my work is into it. And it's not very often I hear metal coming from anywhere else other than the occasional Metallica or disturbed. 

It's kind of a niche taste really. But there's people out there who can vibe with you. Just not as many as ones who want to listen to pop and country. And with you're pallette being so refined, it's going to be hard to find others your age who have the same taste. 

I'm sorry I can't offer anything other than that right now. As you get older and see more of the world, you will find friends that you can practice with and do things like concerts (whether youre spectating or performing). Just be proud of your talents and have fun increasing your skill.

Obsessed,Olivia Rodrigo,all,1jkncm4,"Feeling discouraged because I'm a teenager who loves metal drumming and music, but all my friends and family hate it.

As you get older you will find them and have more means to travel and move to go to places where they are more abundant.

My advice though, is keep practicing with a passion so when you do find them they will respect your skill and want you to be in their band.

It also does not hurt to find other genres and get good at those. Especially if you wanna be a pro drummer. It only enhances your discipline of this skill …and no joke you can find crazy inspirations by genre blending techniques and riffs into metal (stuff just a pure metal head wouldn’t know). If you join a band and need to create the drum arrangement from scratch knowing stuff like this makes writing music easier because you got a bigger book of ideas to pull from. Knowing more and being good at more never hurts you in life (just stay focused and be sure to master something your passionate about though, then generalize in rest). It just opens up possibilities you never knew you had or even know you wanted. You may even find a paid gig working with a band that’s not metal and use that as a gateway to expand out and meet more people.",1,2025-03-26 22:47:19

When I was 15 ( 2005)and went to my first local metal core show it was life changing. Also you’ll find that there are people there around your age interested in the thing you’re interested in.

Try showing them the drums without the track, in my experience, even if the people around me don’t like the OG track, they’ll still appreciate the musicianship that you put in.

It’s the long standing stereotype that Metal is alternative and fridge culture going all the way back to the beginning - Black Sabbath was considered satanic for Tony Iommi’s use of dissonance, Judas Priest was gay leather rebellion, even in Twisted Sister’s opus of “We’re not gonna take it” the entire music video is about rebelling against an oppressive and unsupportive parent. Most of black metal was rebellion against the conservative Christian populism… although some of them took it in a weird direction lol

Anyway, pop literally stands for “Popular.”

Don’t be discouraged, as you grow up and find more musicians you’ll find people in your interests. Niches are hard to fill but you will find them, hell have you heard of Bloodywood? There’s no metal scene whatsoever in New Delhi and they managed to find each other.

You’re 15, it’s not like you can drop everything and go on tour right now, just give it time.

If you think about it… what’s the ratio of people that like metal at your school? Just you outta 2000 people? So 0.05% of people like metal?

At that ratio there’s 4,115,000 metalheads out there waiting to stank face and blegh for you.

Source: an old metalhead that was stifled in catholic school and didn’t start finding people to go to Meshuggah concerts with until his 20s… pic for attention. It’s a shot I took of Jens Kidman in 2015 when you were 5.

I know as a drummer you just want to drum. But as a drummer with no surrounding community, if you choose to pursue remote drumming, you'll have to pick up some audio engineering skills so you can self track and deliver what your band mates and/or clients are looking for.

I'm a lot older, and can tell you this is normal and probably won't change. :) I'm lucky to be married to someone with similar taste, and met others through forums, at shows, in clubs etc. who like music. People who really understand or even play music can appreciate many different genres, so you'll have a better chance discussing metal tunes with a jazz musician than with a pop fan. Just be patient. You probably have to get a little older to join some of the activities where you can find similar people, and choosing a school can also get you in certain crowds. An engineering career might yield a little more metalheads than certain others.

In the end the average population is like people around you now. I can go for years without meeting any other human who's ever heard of Opeth or Gojira.

I now play in a touring metal band and with the friends I’ve made along the way I no longer feel any discomfort or discouragement I used to feel when I could only seek praise from parents or other close friends who didn’t share that interest. I love what I do, and over time the people in my life have grown used to it and are much more open to metal as they see it’s my passion. Yours will too, it just takes time.

Best thing you can do (which helped me) is stop rooting for approval and appreciation for that particular genre interest in people who won’t give it. It sucks, especially when it’s your parents / close friends etc, but find your people and they’ll give you all the encouragement and support you need. Parents and friends won’t stop supporting and loving you, they just won’t always understand our interests in the same way.

We can’t all like the same things, and unfortunately metal is just one of those interests that most people don’t like. It’s a reality that becomes more apparent as time goes on, but it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stop rocking dude. Keep going, find your people, enjoy what makes you happy, and love that it does just that! When I was your age I wish I didn’t take it to heart as much, they likely mean no harm but it doesn’t feel good either way, I’m sure most of us can relate. If music doesn’t make you happy there’s no point in my opinion, so you do you!

Any advice?",mjwokmz,HeWasaLonelyGhost,"That sucks, dude. Just keep playing. If nobody is playing metal, I would try to find other musicians to jam with, even if it's not really your cup of tea, and just start getting out there. You'd be surprised what connections you make. It also can scratch the collaborative, songwriting, performing itches, even if it's not quite what you want. Keep seeking out those opportunities and saying ""yes"" to them, and I really think you'll be surprised what other doors that can open up.

Secondly, keep doing your own independent things. It is a cool time, in some senses, to be a solo musician. You can do a lot of your own recording and writing and even performing on your own. It sounds like you have a channel--even if nobody watches it, I would still recommend doing it. There is value in getting used to performing; getting used to getting a clean take; getting used to the production side of things; and it's also a chance for you to leave your mark on the world and track your progress. You also may be surprised to find that that opens up doors, too, if you're good and can get some attention.

Another thing you might think about is making a ""Fiver"" account, and selling your drumming services. As you said you have some material to show off, already, it seems like you could set a low price at first, and try to build up a body of work.

Finally, another thing that you could do is just kind of make your own collaborations...so like if a metal guitar player has a video you like, you could record your own take on the drums and post a virtual ""collab.""

Any advice?",mjwqupg,timmybones607,"I’d just say “who cares.” It sounds like you’re surrounded by small-minded people if they can’t look past the music to appreciate your passion. Just ignore them, keep practicing but *don’t* plan on drums being your profession when you grow up, and you’ll soon be able to leave and choose your own life and whom you associate with. I know it’s hard now, but time is an extremely powerful force of change, I promise you.

That said, as a fellow metal lover that has no one in his life with the same taste in music…it’s ok. You don’t need to have the same taste as everyone. My recommendation is to find one good friend or bf/gf that will go to shows with you despite not liking the music. If none of your friends or family will do that, I’d argue they don’t care about you and you should distance yourself from that relationship as much as possible. But one person is really all you need to support your interest (you absolutely can go to shows solo but it’s less fun so not a good long-term strategy.) You may have to reciprocate this with your friend, and that’s fine; there’s lots of excellent music out there that’s not metal, and being exposed to it will help you in the long run.",3,2025-03-26 21:51:02

My advice is to find the thing that keeps you going for you. Playing with people and playing for people is really fun, but find something that makes you proud of yourself and keep doing that.

It's a bit more difficult as you are young and going to a metal show solo is probably out of sight, but hang in there man. Opportunities will arise!

Just make sure to go to settings and force .mp3 audio format in the Output category. From there, you can download tens of songs at once and copy them over to your watch with ease.

A lot of people uses Spotify, but I believe there are Spotify to YouTube playlist converter out there - once you convert, just copy paste the link into the software shown in this post. Click Download. Copy Paste. Voila.

This post was inspired by /u/frogmaxi who was asking about podcasts. Same instructions - the software itself can do single video links or playlists. Just copy paste the link and you're good to go.

Hozier has talked in an interview about touring and being up late, like could be falling asleep at 4-5am. 
The person who is too sweet is going to bed earlier, and that person wakes up for the sunrise but tells the singer to go to bed before the daylight - to go to bed before dawn. 
The narrator/Hozier sings that it’s 10 o’clock before he says a word, like that is the morning and he has slept in.

...    
*You keep telling me to live right*   
*To go to bed before the daylight*   
*But then you wake up for the sunrise*

Like, very first thing he does in the song is establish that he goes to bed & wakes up late, and the person he's singing about goes to bed & wakes up early. *And* that they think he should change his habits and live like they do, but he doesn't want to.

While yes, it's rare to see metal acts in the Hot 100, Sleep Token is barely that at all. 90% of Sleep Token's music sounds exactly like pop that is ALREADY massively popular. Twenty One Pilots, Imagine Dragons, etc. Their primary fanbase ISN'T metal fans, but rather everyday pop listeners.  
  
It's unlikely to pave the way for other metal acts because it's not actually acclimatizing people to a heavier sound. Metallica's popularity in the early 90's with *Enter Sandman*, for example, directly made bands like Pantera, Primus, Slayer, and Jane's Addiction more viable because *heavier sounds were now more accepted in the mainstream*.  
  
People aren't hearing this and discovering a love for heavy music. Sleep Token sanitizes the heavy elements so much that they are effectively making ""metal-music for people who dislike metal"". Many of their songs have no guitar for 80% of it and will have like 1 djent breakdown near the end.  
  
I just feel like this is unlikely to actually bring new eyes to metal (like Ghost arguably did in the 2010s) as a subgenre because it fundamentally doesn't appeal to metal fans. Metal fans need to like it too on average for that to happen. It's one thing to be controversial, it's another to be a black sheep in your genre.",79,2025-05-21 12:33:56

Post-pandemic, there’s been a steady stream of metal and rock adjacent bands that have been picking up stream and have decent followings. Most of them are thrown into the free for all genres of post hardcore or metalcore, but so many of these bands mix elements and genres. Holding Absence and Dayseeker are bands that mix metal with a dreamscape sound, Magnolia Park and Hot Milk come from pop punk, The Plot in You has had some major success in the past few years blending more elements into their sound. All of these bands will go on tour with heavier sounding and pop sounding bands. Several of them have actually toured with Sleep Token. The thing I have noticed with these bands is that their fan bases are more welcoming and inclusive than pure metal, allowing for more growth. 

The main reason I’d say sleep token grew so fast and so big is the lore aspect, people love a good mystery and putting all of the hidden messages together. I don’t think that sleep token are always going to be selling out stadiums, but the crossover appeal to different genres really does help them out, and I won’t be surprised if in five years they’ll still be relevant",2,2025-05-21 17:24:27

They have of course crossed over a lot, but no, it's not everyday pop fans making Sleep Token so big.

The metalheads are having a tough time accepting that there's now enough kids and young people getting into metal to make a band like Sleep Token big without any of their help. These kids are fine with metal blended with full on pop because they've grown up in a world where they can listen to everything, and a lot of them also like pop. The true metallers are still scratching their heads on why it's this band.

And the reason it's this band, outside of the aforementioned, is the aesthetic, the lore, the presentation - and the choices in that particular area would absolutely *NOT* appeal to the average everyday pop fan, regardless of how the actual music sounds.

Too Sweet,Hozier,all,1kngips,Too Sweet,mso1g8l,Lowkey_kier0605,"I feel like a lot of people get really connected to music. It’s quite natural music has been around for soooo long in some form. It provides community, comfort, understanding, joy, laughter, it facilitates dance, it tells stories, it speaks on things one may otherwise be uncomfortable to speak of. I think it’s normal and quite healthy to get attached to music or artists because to many people, it’s not always just a song. For instance, using Hozier, I’m severely attached to the song “Swan Upon Leda” it was written after the overturn of roe v wade and it compares men controlling women’s bodies to men conquering holy land. It’s a retelling of the story of Leda and the swan in Greek mythology in which Zeus transformed into a swan to r-word Leda. She then got pregnant and gave birth to his children. It’s a subject that hits close to home because that happened to my mom. It’s about female empowerment, it’s about protecting women and children who are victims, it’s about basic human rights. It’s not just a song. It’s an anthem to those who feel attacked. Maybe try to understand how music may affect and comfort people before saying “it’s just a song”.

So to make sure I get what you're trying to say, you're looking for songs that we associate in ""Vibe"" that have no lyrical connection to the actual character? 

Or are you explicitly asking for a meta-statement on OUR personal feelings on a song in regards to the character such as ""This song describes how I feel toward this character."" I got that impression from the first half of the post, but the second shook that a bit and left me confused...

I have a pretty extensive knowledge of music since I play a few instruments and analyze composition, mixing audio production, etc. I'd call myself a musician, but it's cringe if you give yourself the title...

I'd have to say for Junko, one song that captures both of those possibilities comes from a band I otherwise hate.

Do I Wanna Know by Arctic Monkeys, the way that this basic hammering dead beat pounds away in the background, the recurring layers within the song, the soft backing vocals that contrast with the disorganized out of sync lead vocals, all tied into the overlapping vocals. The layering and overstimulation of so many voices and separate tunes, beats and riffs overlaid by the end forces me to lose track of the song till I can't follow all of them at the same time and I don't even know what I'm supposed to pay attention to, all wrapped up with those falling vocals at the end, just...

""Gloomy Sunday"" – Björk cover
Also called the “Hungarian Suicide Song,” it drips despair like poisoned honey. It’s soft, slow, and soaked in hopelessness, the kind that doesn’t scream but seduces you into the abyss. And really, isn't that what despair should be?

""I am the Walrus"" – The Beatles.
Because beneath the psychadelia is pure nihilism. Nonsense masquerading as meaning, language devoured by absurdity: I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together. Exactly. The cosmos is a joke and we're the punchline.

""Blackstar"" – David Bowie
Because even the god-king of glam couldn't outrun the collapse. “I'm not a pop star… I’m a blackstar.” It’s prophetic. A death-song wrapped in cosmic jazz. Decay dressed as transcendence. Bowie turned his own death into art, into myth, into despair you can dance to.

“People = Shit” – Slipknot
Because humanity is filth wrapped in self-delusion. This track captures the primal scream of a species in denial, crawling over each other for scraps of meaning while pretending it's love. It’s violent, raw, and contemptuous, like Ms. Enoshima if she were a song.

And before you'll go crazy over AI because of dashes, those are en dashes (–), used to connect prefixes or suffixes to proper nouns, and not em dashes (—)—Christ, I can't believe i have to justify that I'm not a computer. We really are in a post-truth wold!",1,2025-05-15 00:46:06

Too Sweet,Hozier,all,1km05lg,I'm curious about something....🤔,ms7wi96,Competitive-Win-893,"First of all, great music taste. 

Also, *this*. You understood the prompt perfectly.
It feels like your song choices here are like a window into your soul.
They're all so unique and help provide a better picture of how you see each character.

So here is my interpretation of the songs you choose/why you choose them. I'm not going to go over them all, just the ones that stood out to me.

Also, I'm not basing my judgements on any of the songs lyrics, just everything else.


> Kirumi with Rolling In The Deep by Adele

I can see where you're coming from with this one. It *feels* very Kirumi, and not just for the lyrics.
First, I think the reason you associate this song was Kirumi is because of its rich and vibrant vocals. Like, a lot of emotion is being conveyed through Adele's singing here. 

This is the kind of song that makes you want to cry and really puts you into the perspective of the person singing it. It's not instrumental heavy, the grungy beat only serves as an accent to the vocals. The grit of the beat conveys ""battle worn"" or ""fierce determination"" when in contrast with the rest of it.

If I had to guess based on this, you see Kirumi as beautiful in general, but this song in particular seemed to touch on her ""quiet passion"" and inner fight.

This is her break through song. This is the song that plays as she loses her composure only to fight for what she believes in. This feels like a fight for identity, a fight for responsibility, and a nod to well of suppressed and underutilized emotions that hide somewhere within Kirumi.

Basically, it's giving ""Kirumi is more than just her competence or her sophistication, and she's even more than just her status as a maid. She *is* beautiful because she has something to fight for. And her passion, dedication, and loyalty are what make her compelling""


> Byakuya with Mirror Man by Jack Stauber

I love this so much. It's so abstract and nothing like Byakuya that it's exactly what I was looking for with this prompt. 
The fact that you picked this song definitely tells me a bit about the way you see Byakuya. Although, I could be wrong.

This song gives ""anxious, lost, and desperately running from something"" or ""cosmically adrift"" vibes. But, the sort of ""uppity"" accent that he uses during certain parts of the song would probably make it easier to see byakuya somewhere in there.

It's a very playful song, which is nothing like Byakuya at all. But as Jack Stauber usually is, it's very surreal and feels a bit daunting this time. It's definitely a ""stuck in the infinite cosmos while being chased by a giant monster that looks like me and wants to eat me"" type of song. (If that makes any sense)

So, if I had to guess based on this song, I'd assume that you see Byakuya someone who is completely detached from other people and on his own mental wavelength.
The fact that you choose this song makes me think that you see byakuya as unstable and fundamentally off balance/insecure underneath his demeanor. 

You probably see byakuya as someone who is proverbially ""running from himself"" via his crafted exterior. A bit too out of his depth.
But the fact that you choose a song so playful also makes me think that you find this contradiction a bit funny/ironic. 

So basically, I'm thinking you see byakuya as ""aww. A little rich boy who tries his best to be cool"". And I'd also imagine that you take his character in a playful way.

At least, those are the vibes I gathered. As always, I could be wrong.


> Kokichi with Hand Me My Shovel, I'm Going In by Will Wood

The will wood here is incredibly based. I honestly listen to this song at least twice a month. 

Although, I'm particularly passionate about my ""will wood kokichi"" allegories.
If I had to assign kokichi any song, let alone just a will wood song, it would be ""Outliers and Hypocrites: a fun fact about apples"". 
Its lyrics are so incredibly Kokichi in every way. Although, it doesn't really fit the ""subject vibes"" standard in this case because most of the lyrics tie into kokichi's actual personality.

But anyways, back to your song.

If we're going off of vibes alone and not lyrics, this totally makes sense.
It's super vibrant and energized, it feels very charismatic and fun.
By the nature of a will wood song, it's constantly changing from fast to slow, the vocals are really animated, the instrumentals are playful. 
It's so incredibly intense that it makes sense why you would associate it with kokichi's vibrant and similarly intense personality.

However, this is one of those ones that makes me go ""Damn. This is how y'all see kokichi? No wonder you like him.""

But touching again on the ""charismatic"" part. The instrumental is playful, yes, but it's also a bit theatrical/showy. 
If this song were a person, it would speak confidently and with its whole chest. This song is NOT bitch made whatsoever.

Although, its repetitious nature during the chorus feels very ""desperate"" and panicked.
(That could be a stretch, though)


So, if I had to guess, you probably see kokichi as someone fun, vibrant, and charismatic. 
You probably *also* see kokichi's playful charisma and wit as his best feature/quality. 
But, you also recognize his insecurities, flaws, and vulnerabilities as valid parts of his character. You see him as confident, but also desperate and missing something crucial in his life. 

But my most likely assumption is that you probably don't take him all that seriously either and mainly enjoy the playful parts of his character rather than the cruel or tragic ones. 
I'd definitely probably say that you see a bit of yourself in kokichi and like to embrace his chaotic and playful nature.",1,2025-05-14 04:43:56

Too Sweet,Hozier,all,1km05lg,I'm curious about something....🤔,msk8680,Competitive-Win-893,"Ooh. This was a fun one to analyze!
Here is what I thought:

> Nagito - Phony by Kafu

From this song, I can sort of gather (more like take a guess) at how you see Nagito as a character.

This song is very fast paced and playful, but it has a very distant, overwhelming, and sometimes ""glitchy"" vibe to it.

If I had to take a guess, I'd assume that you probably see Nagito as someone who is controlled by his own emotions rather than him being the one influencing them.
You think Nagito is chaotic and unhinged, but not aimlessly or for surface level reasons.

Maybe you see him as someone who is *constantly on edge* or in such a state of mind that never allows him to rest or relax. His obsession with hope feels more ""all consuming"" and ""stressful"" than it feels empowering.

But the constant vibe/tone shifts in the song where it's shifting from faster to slower, more animated to less animated. This makes me think that you really resonate with the ""overwhelmed"" and ""out of control"" aspects of his psyche.
Going from high energy to low energy, frantic joy to frantic sorrow, deep and personal pain to overwhelming pleasure. 
That's a *lot* for Nagito to have to endure due to the state of his mind. He makes everything around him more chaotic, but the world itself is overwhelming even to *him*. And if you think that about him, it reflects in the song you chose.

However, I also assume that beneath his unhinged condition, you see him as someone that can have moments of clarity or introspection that *feel* incredibly human.
He might long for sincerity or a break from the constant chaos, but the moments where he does are so brief and fleeting that they feel more like a glitch than anything else.

And, yes, the glitchy feel of the song sort of stood out to me, it's a bit symbolic in some ways.
The chaos, the ""distorted"" mindset, the sort of ""stuck and trapped"" vibe that the analog sound gives off. 
Like being trapped in a television or perpetual dream state, Nagito is trapped in his own mindset and obsession. 


And on less of a ""character psychology"" level and more on just a personal feelings level, this song is really fast paced and sometimes playful, which I assume gives way to your positive feelings about him or enjoyment of his character.

Overall based song choice. This was my attempt at a guess, so if I got anything wrong let me know.


> Izuru - Bothersome by Jack Stauber

This one was a bit more obvious when I heard it. I got hit with a wave of emotions radiating off of this song.

It feels very humble and nostalgic, like the kind of song you would hear playing in the final episode of a TV show or as you watch the sun go down by the beach. 
Very melancholy, but not in a cold way. The hidden warmth of the song is not lost on me.

But based on this song, my hypothesis is that you don't see Izuru as cruel, dangerous, or ""inhuman"", so to speak, you view him for *what he has lost*. 

What I mean is, you see Izuru as a former shell of what he once was. You probably mourn the loss of his humanity, the loss of his possibility for genuine connection.
Even though he's technically alive, this song makes me think that you might view him as, not entirely tortured or edgy, but resigned, faded, distant, and a poster child for *what could have been*.

The vibes of this song are so incredibly specific that it's easy to pinpoint but still complicated nonetheless.
I'd take a gander that, in your eyes, Izuru is someone who *could have loved*, could have had a life, could have had connections, could have experienced the world in such a *human* way, and now he's lost it all in a way that *can never be undone*. 

But, I think a crucial point to mention is the fact that the song, even though it feels sort of empty or distant, isn't cold or mechanical, it's still warm. 
It still feels introspective, caring, and nostalgic. 

This suggests that you don't see Izuru's numbness as apathy, more like grief and sorrow. 
It makes the song feel more like ""Izuru wants to care so badly, but he's no longer human, can no longer feel and is resigned to watching the world pass by him instead of genuinely living in it."".
He's trapped in a limbo of resignation and regret. And most importantly, he's burdened. 
Burdened by the weight of his sorrow, the weight of what he's lost, and the weight of *what he'll never have again*



But yeah, those are my hypotheses, but I'd love to know if I was right or completely missed the mark. These pics were super interesting.",2,2025-05-16 02:43:57

Too Sweet,Hozier,all,1km05lg,I'm curious about something....🤔,msm5yq2,CrystalAbysses,"Wow omg I didn't expect such a thoughtful response!! You're absolutely right about both of the songs, especially Izuru. Most people see him on his surface actions, that he is cruel and apathetic, but there are so many instances where he is undeniably human and emotional. Of course the scene where he is crying over Chiaki's death comes to mind, but there are other instances as well, like how in the  UTDP he seems to actually enjoy other people's company, how he kept a vase of flowers and maybe even took care of them right before Makoto captured him for the FF. I guess with all of this information, I view Izuru more like someone *suppressing* his emotions rather than having none at all.

Izuru to me just feels so sad, like someone mourning the loss of something that he can never get back. I don't think Izuru *wants* to be this cold and apathetic person, after all he admitted that he doesn't find any joy in killing or hurting other people like Junko does, he just thinks that everyone around him couldn't possibly match up to his own intellectual skills, and therefore he's alone. Alone, wandering around, trying to find entertainment in a burning world that he helped create. You're very good at this analytical stuff!",3,2025-05-16 12:37:32

Too Sweet,Hozier,all,1kib3r4,Explanation of Too Sweet,mrdjpbl,Sea-Bench252,"I think it’s just about realizing you are not compatible with someone you love. You’re not wrong, they’re not wrong, you’re just on different life paths. Perhaps both parties think they’re living the “right way” and that their partner could stand to make some changes, but they won’t. 

There’s also a little bit of a naive vs jaded in some of the lyrics. Especially the verse “You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain, Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape, If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait, Until that day..” I think it’s kind of “you’ll see eventually life isn’t as sweet as you think it is, even grapes turn into wine eventually”. I really like the song and I don’t think it’s as much of a diss-track (if you will) as Anything But is. 

Finally, there’s wedding bells in the background, but I heard something about them being played in a minor key…I have very little music knowledge, but to me that’s like a hint to almost making it to the altar, but realizing there’s something wrong (incompatibility).",81,2025-05-09 05:56:00
Too Sweet,Hozier,all,1kib3r4,Explanation of Too Sweet,mrexpaq,allycat315,"I believe he said he got the idea from an Irish saying ""too sweet to be savory"" which to me implies a sort of fakeness about someone's personality or the way they present themselves. I think of how a lot of social media is curated to make someone appear a certain way, and how that can lead to distrust of that person from someone looking in. 

That sort of mask can also be pretty common early in a relationship, such as a girl not wanting to use the bathroom at her boyfriend's house or a boy not wanting to introduce his girlfriend to his friends because he acts differently around them.

I think this is the kind of thing Too Sweet touches on, saying ""I live my life for my own enjoyment, and I don't want to be with someone more concerned with curating their image than with having fun or meaningful experiences"" - which can be taken as a negative statement, but it can also be more of a neutral ""we're just not compatible"" as someone else mentioned.",25,2025-05-09 13:14:51

Or conversely two people on different sides of their saturn return. The younger believing they have all the processes worked out to live a perfect life and the older knowing that isnt possible and amused at the bittersweet future this girl is about to experience.

It reminds me of another song - ""the last time I felt your weight on my chest you said we didnt do it right but love we did our best"" - so it sounds like he has written about similar outcomes from the opposite POV as well.

Too Sweet,Hozier,all,1kcfoxp,"Should OneRepublic, Twenty One Pilots, Imagine Dragons, etc. type of artists be considered its own subgenre?",mq2elf1,MMChelsea,"I am a big fan of his so may be somewhat biased, but I think that's quite harsh on Hozier and Take Me To Church. To compare him to the likes of Believer isn't particularly accurate. I have no real issue with Imagine Dragons or OneRepublic, but they are very much pop artists.

Take Me To Church is a pretty strong and unique combination of the blues, rock and folk that define most of Hozier's music. I think the depth of the lyrics and the subject matter (the Church in Ireland, and, more generally, homophobia) are impressive and really struck a chord. To be honest, I am surprised it was as popular as it was as I would have a polar opposite opinion on the song - it's very atypical for a radio song, both musically and lyrically. It would probably be classified as blues rock or folk rock, but you certainly couldn't file it under pop.

Generally, I think his lyrical ability and vocals greatly exceed the other artists mentioned. Unfortuantely, TMTC was overplayed on radio, as you mentioned, but I don't think that should cause it to be considered to be in a similar genre to standard pop. 

I will agree that Too Sweet fits in this subgenre you're thinking about - it's, in my opinion, an unfortunate direction that he's gone down and is the most blatantly 'poppy' song of the Unreal Unearth project. It's regular, established pop and it could be by any of those artists you mentioned. However, I'm sure he's made plenty of money from it, so good for him.

I don't know, for me the whole ethos of this kind of music is that it's blatantly very *of center* while putting on a facade of being left-field. I see the whole wave of commercialized Starbucks ""indie"" music of that era like Fun, Echosmith, Grouplove, Of Monsters and Men, etc in a similar light also—those groups were able to capitalize on repackaging the sounds of indie music into a safe, radio-friendly product squarely aimed at the mainstream market. It’s just barely eccentric and varied enough to garner outsider appeal while being as amicable and accessible as pop music gets. Similar to the artists mentioned by OP.

I was having a flick through his discography after writing this and I'd say aside from features, maybe Damage Gets Done, No Plan, and Too Sweet are his only out and out pop songs. In any case, I think his songwriting is his most brilliant attribute, which is saying something given his vocal talent.

In Swan Upon Leda alone, he explores 4-5 complex themes when most mainstream artists would struggle to write a song about one of them. In Through Me, he paints the most vivid image of grief I have ever heard. In the most stunning of ways, Run allegorises English colonialism in Ireland as an abusive relationship. 

The chorus of Dinner and Diatribes uses a desert blues guitar; Almost includes no fewer than 17 references to classic jazz standards; De Selby Part 1 and Uiscefhuaraithe embrace our beautiful Irish language; From Eden has a flamenco bridge; Jackboot Jump is a dirty blues protest song. Hell, the guy has a whole album based around Dante's Inferno. These are not aspects that you generally would find in the discography of Imagine Dragons/OneRepublic!

Well, an atom bomb in the form of 37 Morgan Wallen songs is coming when his new album is released on May 16th. Expect *ALOT* of the songs that’ve had extended stays to finally end their run that week. 

In a sense it’s a good thing as it’ll freshen up the charts and get rid of lingering older songs that stagnate the charts, but also, fuck Morgan Wallen and his shitty (admittedly popular) music.

my point was that one single point could make the difference between 4 different positions on the chart, so using an early prediction as if it is a final prediction or to even imply that the window is closed is inaccurate.

now if it doesn't end up in the top 8 next week, don't come back here to tell me 'i told you so', because i'm not saying it will be top 8, i'm saying that using early predictions is inaccurate because of how much the final chart might end up differing.

The effort might bear fruit in the age to come, if not in this one if return is still possible.

1. Exactly, he talks about how (for a ‘rebirth’) it would be needed that some Westerners ‘re-approached’ their own tradition (Christianity) “in the light of Eastern wisdom”. What is unclear to me, though, is whether he believed that “this light could be shed by the East” _without_ the need for a direct approach, i.e. without initiation into these Eastern doctrines. This raises the question: can the knowledge required for such ‘rebirth’ be acquired purely through ‘indirect’ means (such as books)? I imagine that the answer would be ‘yes’, as I don’t see what else Guénon might have implied, but I wanted to hear what people here thought of this.

> Guenon did consider hesychasm to be initiatic and a possible way of casting some light on western christian initiatic organizations

Interesting! Do you perchance remember in which of his works (or letters) he speaks about hesychasm?

> When he speaks of Christianity he's almost always speaking of Catholicism; even more so when he speaks about western Christianity or the west in general. I'm not aware that he conisdered Eastern Europe or Eastern Orthodoxy to be the west? Where did you get that from?

In the same chapter he mentions how Russians are ‘Western’ in the same way as other Europeans; but I was mainly thinking about this passage in the I chapter of _Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines_:

> But we must make it clear that, apart from Muslim elements, we do not in any way regard as Orientals the people who inhabit the east of Europe […]

I’d say that if this is the case for the Eastern European peoples, the same could be said about the Eastern Orthodox religion. However, there is no doubt, in my opinion, that Eastern Orthodoxy and its main homeland, i.e. Eastern Europe, are ‘much closer to the trunk’ than Catholicism (or Protestantism, of course) — following Guénon’s image of the Western civilisation being a sort of ‘deviated branch’ which has diverged too far from the unitary Traditional ‘trunk’ to which all of the Eastern civilisations’ ‘branches’ are very close.",1,2025-05-28 13:02:03
APT,Rose,all,1kwrzqp,Regarding the final chapter of the Crisis of the Modern World (“Some conclusions”),mup3n1d,LazySvep,"1 Obviously initiation is still alive in the West; it can never go fully extinct or else the West would no longer exist as what it is now since the supra-human forces would then have to intervene to restore the primordial state. The spirit can never go fully extict. Another point is that Catholicism, even though Guenon believed became exoteric can never really fully become so, since it was initiatic to begin with. So the initiatic possibilities are still there but in a 'latent state'. He also mentions this but again I can't remember where exactly. It is this that can eventually be re-discovered if the right conditions are met since it can't really go anywhere given the traditional origins of Catholicism. He also says that prinicipally it has to contain possibilities of the supreme state (deliverance) even though no one in the west is really capable of discovering this. So to answer your question, it's all there but concealed and by the help of understainding the eastern doctrines or even just Guenon's works one might be able to re-discover what is today very well hidden.

Another point and a very interesting one is that Schuon disagreed with Guenon that Catholicism lost it's initiatic character and that even today and forever the sacraments are initiatic, because they can never lose their original nature. It's only that the masses are unaware of this and thus they are mostly used to save as many people as possible but the spiritual influence is always there and can act in other domains if needed.

3 He talks about this in ""Christianity and Initiation"", a chapter from the book ""Insights into Christian esoterism"". I recommend you look there for all your questions. I very much recommend you also read Schuon's ""Rene Guenon - some observations"" (the parts about Christianity at least) after you've read Christianity and Initiation.

I think it's very obvious that he means Catholicism and Masonry when he talks about the West, not Eastern Orthodoxy. Those are probably just geographical considerations and that he would consider Eastern Orthodoxy entirely ""Eastern"", as do the Eastern Orthodox themselves. Obvisouly the spirit there is nothing like in the West and entirely like in the East, as you've rightly noticed.",2,2025-05-28 13:32:47
APT,Rose,all,1kwrzqp,Regarding the final chapter of the Crisis of the Modern World (“Some conclusions”),muprjjr,h2wlhehyeti,"Thank you for your answers and recommendations. So far, I have only read the first two chapters of *Insights into Christian esoterism*. In the chapter you mentioned (""Christianity and Initiation""), Guénon talks about hesychasm and says that it is a true initiatic path; it is not clear to me if he believed that hesychasm could 'provide' a path to Deliverance itself or only to 'lower' states. Also, just a few lines below his paragraph on hesychasm, he wrote (and I've reported in bold the parts which interest us most in this conversation):

>In conclusion, we can say that despite its initiatic origins **Christianity in its present state is certainly nothing more than a religion, that is, an exclusively exoteric tradition, and that it contains no possibilities other than those possessed by any other exoterism.** Moreover, it makes no claim to more, because there is never a question of anything else but gaining ‘salvation’. **An initiation can naturally be superimposed upon it, and normally would even have to be**, in order for the tradition to be truly complete, possessing effectively both esoteric and exoteric aspects; **but this initiation does not currently exist in Christianity, at least in its Western form.** \[...\]

So, (1) he seems to say that present-day Christianity is an exclusively exoteric tradition; this mostly aligns with what he had said on Christianity in a general sense, but his use of the term ""exclusively"" is somewhat confusing, as he seems to have also implied (just a few lines above this passage) that hesychasm represents the last -- or one of the last -- true initiatic path within Christianity, and unless I'm misunderstanding his use of these terms, I'd expect this to mean that he also considered hesychasm an *esoteric* path. 

And (2) he then says that an initiatic path would have to be superimposed upon the Christian sacraments in order for the tradition to be complete both exoterically and esoterically, and he claims that this initiation does not currently exist in Christianity -- and, with a certain ambiguity, he adds that this applies ""at least"" to Western Christianity, even though what he had just said regarding hesychasm made it quite clear that the latter is indeed a true initiatic path in Christianity.

Thus, trying to extract from this passage a 'conclusive judgement', we might say that he considered Catholicism to have become a purely exoteric tradition, while Eastern Orthodoxy  still conserves its esoteric core, together with the exoteric aspect common to all Christian denominations.

If he *did* think that Eastern Orthodoxy still possessed both the exoteric *and* the esoteric aspects (albeit in a scarcely accessible path, when it comes to the latter) which are required for it to be a 'complete tradition' in the Guénonian sense, then why did he never talk about this path when considering which traditional paths were still possible for Europeans? He considered Islam to be the 'most accessible' traditional path 'available' to Westerners, but why ignore Eastern Orthodoxy?

\------

Also, another doubt of mine regards the following passage:

>In hesychasm, initiation in the strict sense consists essentially in the regular transmission of certain formulas, exactly comparable to the transmission of *mantras* in the Hindu tradition and of the *wird* in the Islamic *turuq*.

This seems to say that the 'means' of initiation in hesychasm is the 'transmission of formulas"", rather than the initiation into higher 'ranks' of the monastic life; what do you think of this? Might it mean that Guénon did not view monasticism as an 'essential requisite' for hesychasm, thus perhaps implying that 'non-monks' could still somewhat access this path (e.g. a 'non-monk' having an Athonite monk as a spiritual teacher)?

\------

On a quite unrelated note, I imagine he didn't, but do you perhaps know if he ever mentioned *Oriental* Orthodoxy (the Armenian, Ethiopian, Coptic etc. Churches -- the miaphysite Christians, essentially) and its traditions in any of his works or letters?",1,2025-05-28 15:30:06
APT,Rose,all,1kwrzqp,Regarding the final chapter of the Crisis of the Modern World (“Some conclusions”),muq6d45,LazySvep,">Thus, trying to extract from this passage a 'conclusive judgement', we might say that he considered Catholicism to have become a purely exoteric tradition, while Eastern Orthodoxy still conserves its esoteric core, together with the exoteric aspect common to all Christian denominations.

I think this is correct, yes. Hesychasm is obviously esoteric in that it's not available to everyone - that's the definition of esoterism.

>He considered Islam to be the 'most accessible' traditional path 'available' to Westerners, but why ignore Eastern Orthodoxy?

He very rarely talked about Eastern Orthodoxy, it makes you wonder how aware he was of it's existence and depth. Schuon also says it's not obvious that he would've become a muslim had he not met a sufi friend in Egypt and it's definitely something to consider that Guenon's views could've been influenced by rather contingent matters or other considerations. He also didn't talk about Buddhism much and he never once mentioned Chan Buddhism, which was obviously initiatic and very profound.

At some point you just have to go and do trust your own judgement, not Guenon's. There's plenty of areas where you could argue your own point or simply see that your nature and your path are unique and that his path might not be your own. The distinction between esoteric and exoteric is not so black and white. It's about realizing your spiritual potential, not putting yourself in a box. He also say you should not go looking for more if you're satisified at the level you're at as that could bring disorder.

Orhtodox elders and monastics don't talk about initiation and other this stuff Guenon talks about. If an Anthonite monk 'adopted' you or gave you orders, would you ask if you've now recieved the holy spirit and been initiated and blah blah; or follow as if Christ commanded? You get a different perspective when you're inside the tradition, not outside like Guenon was.",2,2025-05-28 16:41:15

I fully agree with you. In fact, I pretty much already have my own thoughts regarding Orthodox Christianity (to which I have been feeling strongly ‘called’ lately) and I’m not even convinced of the Traditionalist/perennialist opinion of considering it to be simply ‘one tradition amongst many’. I am very interested in understanding Guénon’s thoughts on the matter though, as I respect him very much and admire many aspects of his life and works. In addition to this, it is also useful to understand Guénon’s ‘critiques’ or analyses to be able to better understand the ‘responses’ that Christian Traditionalists (such as Jean Borella) have given to Guénon’s thoughts on Christianity.

> The distinction between esoteric and exoteric is not so black and white. 

I agree on this too. And Schuon’s description of Christianity as being “exotericised esoterism”, as I think it renders the idea very well. 

> It's about realizing your spiritual potential, not putting yourself in a box. He also say you should not go looking for more if you're satisified at the level you're at as that could bring disorder. […]

These are all wise words with which I agree. I hope I have cleared my position on these matters up.

As others have said, the perfect proposal really depends on the 2 of you. You mention the hiking plans, which tells me she enjoys hiking and nature. So do I. 

Assuming she and I have some things in common, I vote for the proposal to occur on the hike as you have planned. To me, there is nothing better than to be out in the great wide open, seeing God's majesty all around me, to share the beauty of the landscape with the one I love most, feel like the world is all ours and anything is possible.  When I'm on a summit, I feel like I can see forever.  That exhilarating feeling could only be topped by having my soulmate tell me he wants to share forever with me.

The added bonus is that it gives the 2 of you several hours to bask in the glow of being engaged before you rejoin civilization and share the news with others. Plus, think how epic the photos from the summit will be once shared!

Later when you go out for your nice dinner, you'll be able to have the nice photos of you guys all dressed up for the 'gram (Insta? I'm much older so I'm not up on the lingo). It's the best of both worlds. While I am the kind of woman who never leaves the house without makeup (I even hike with makeup on because my makeup has a high SPF to protect my skin from the sun) and I love to dress up and be the center of attention (I do community theater),  for things like proposals and weddings, I'm a very private person and prefer intimate settings.",3,2025-05-26 15:32:45

APT,Rose,all,1kuztwf,20 yaşındaki bir gence öneriniz var mı?,mu816pc,Constant-Worker-9939,"""Şunu al, bunu sat"" gibi yorumları dinlememeni, kendi araştırman ve kararların dolayısıyla alım-satım işlemleri yapmanı öneririm. Çünkü ülkemiz ve dünya ekonomisi sürekli değişmekte, belirli dönemlerde kazançlı olan piyasalar belirli dönemlerde kazançlı olmamakta. Örneğin Türkiye'de şu an paranın mevduat faizinden başka bir yerde bulunmasının hiçbir anlamı yok. Çünkü finansal piyasalarda yapacağın işlemler sonucunda, enflasyonun bu kadar yüksek olması karşısında istikrarlı bir şekilde her ay en az enflasyon kadar getiri elde edip üstüne kâr elde edebilmen neredeyse imkansız veya en azından oldukça yüksek riskli. Bazı dönemlerde korunman gerekiyor, çünkü ekonomik kondisyonlar bunu gerektiriyor; içerisinde bulunduğumuz dönem de bu tür bir dönem.


Peki bunu nasıl yapabilirsin, yani nasıl bu tür kondisyonların farkında olup finansal kararlar verebilirsin ? Bunun için öncelikle temel ekonomi bilgisine sahip olman, ekonomik çarkların nasıl döndüğünü anlaman gerekiyor. Sonrasında bu işe ne kadar zaman ayırmak istediğin üzerine düşünmen gerekiyor. Daha sonra bu sorunun cevabıyla beraber bir tüccar mı yoksa bir yatırımcı mı olacağına karar vermen gerekiyor. Sonrasında kendini bu hedef doğrultusunda belirlemiş olduğun doğru kaynaklarla beraber eğitmen, bir strateji oluşturman ve test etmen gerekiyor. Bu noktada unutmaman gereken, işlemlerinin karlılık periyotlarının ne kadar düşük olmasını istiyorsan bu işe o kadar emek vermen gerektiği. Bir yazılımcı olduğunu söylüyorsun, bu durumda belki de senin için en iyisi yatırımcılık veya maksimum swing trading.

Ten thousand nations. Three hundred species. Countless worlds and colonies.

All united under the banner of Federation. 

Such a glorious thing.

We would do anything to protect it.

We HAVE done everything to protect it.

When the Arxur appeared, we uplifted them, seeing the opportunities a sapient predator species under our control could represent. But when we attempted to spurn them to fury, to them into monsters fit to haunt the dark void and drive the prey to the safety of our campfires, it backfired. Spectacularly. Instead of being led by a dictator who could be bargained with, the Arxur united under a zealous crusader, who swore to exterminate the Federation for our crimes against their species. We were unprepared for the ferocity of their destruction, and so the Elders overreacted, purging their taint from the stars instead of allowing their evil to run its course so that they might one day be able to be properly controlled. What a waste. The fools.

When the Consortium was discovered, again, we saw opportunity. A fully fledged predator alliance with technology fit to rival the Federation itself? Who could ask for a greater unifying threat. AND YET… the Elders were “cautious”. They did not want another Arxur, even worse, a coalition of Arxurs, with technology far superior to our own in almost every sense. And so when the predators did not attack, but rather kept to themselves, the Elders hesitated to provoke them as they had the Arxur, fearful of poking the Sun Burrower only to be mauled for their troubles. Instead the Consortium were allowed to remain uncontested, a full society of multiple, predatory species, all coexisting together, lurking at the edge of Federation space. In time, fear turned to curiosity, and curiosity turned into questions, questions that began to erode the foundations of the Narrative, the very thing holding our precious Unity together. 

And so, when the humans were found, and questions became accusations, which became demands. I made the decision. To pretend that the humans had wiped themselves out in nuclear war so that the masses may be quieted, content in the knowledge that at least ONE predator species had behaved as it ought to. Meanwhile, we were to study them, observe them in their undeveloped state, prepare them to become the tools of Unity they were always destined to be.

But now… the Narrative, the LIE, it is in greater danger then ever before. Somehow, the humans breached the Cordon undetected, made contact with the Venlil and the Gojid. And worst of all, they did so “peacefully”. We have already engaged in damage control, silencing Piri and preparing to once more bend the Narrative in our favour. But I fear it will not be enough, that the humans, with their blasted eyes and false empathy, will take the Unity we have sacrificed so much to preserve, and burn it to the ground.

The organizers probably wanted as many songs eligible as possible in order to bring attention to this, so it seems like they were pretty loose with the criteria. Maybe the song just needed to have appeared on Japanese charts in some meaningful way in 2024 before a cut-off date in order to be eligible.

One of the Song of the Year nominees, Idol by Yoasobi, came out in April 2023.

Another song, Hikari by Utada Hikaru, came out in March 2002! That one is from the ""Revival Hit"" category though so it's understandable it went that far back.",104,2025-05-21 16:50:05

Their single album OMG, featuring the song “Ditto,” won the “Best K-Pop Song in Japan” award at the Music Awards Japan 2025. The event took place on May 21 in Kyoto, Japan. NewJeans members include Minji, Hanni, Daniel, Haerin, and HAEIN.

Music Awards Japan is a ceremony created by five major local organizations, including the Recording Industry Association of Japan and several government agencies. The winners are chosen based on objective data such as rankings from Billboard Japan and Oricon charts, as well as votes from more than 5,000 music industry professionals.

Although “Ditto” was released on December 19, 2022, it won the award at this year’s ceremony. This shows that NewJeans’ music remains popular over time and across countries.",9,2025-05-22 07:41:08

However, there's no guarantee that your property will hold value. Historically, property price has gone up in Spain, and I'm not going to lie and say I deeply understand whether economic factors will continue being favorable (WW3, population pyramid is inverted and at some point those who've been holding proprieties will pass...). Do you see yourself staying here for very long, potentially selling your property for more than it cost? Or is depreciation a price you're not willing to pay?


E.g., if you buy a 300k property at 2.5% interest rate, you'd be paying 125k to the bank on interest (I'd be less, as I'm not taking into account the down payment, but you get my point). That's about 1.2k€ a month. But if you rent, a 100% of your rent never comes back as any long term benefit. If you rent for longer than 8.5 years for the same approximate rent, you're ""throwing money away"".",2,2025-05-20 14:21:30

If you buy you have de posibility to pay less every year because of inflation. At the end you have a property. You have the problem that all spanish ""young"" people are having... Perhaps at other economic level but same problem. It's a very personal decision but at the end you need a place to live. for example. I bought a house at 2006 when everyone said... Buy or you are out. 150K in 4 yeras went to 70K. At this moment its near 75% of the original value.

Since you like osmanthus notes, tea notes, fruit notes, and the original Glossier You, have you tried Glossier You Fleur? I’ve been loving it so much. The osmanthus note reminds me of white tea and the apricot skin note is juicy and divine. I also love the prominent salt note that lasts throughout the entire wear time.

Luckily, it doesn’t smell like that on me. 

I was disappointed with Reve and Doux. Weirdly enough, I get palo santo from Reve and was surprised when I read that it was Doux that was supposed to have that note! I actually like Reve on skin (I was surprisingly into the smoky palo santo - it smelled like my local witchy/metaphysical shops) but I’ve only tried it on skin once. I was like buttercream and plum where 😭??? that was the disappointing part. Doux just smelled… odd and off-putting. I can’t even discern any notes from it.

also a piece of unsolicited advice from someone who rly couldnt give a shit abt israel palestine (imo both sides are morally reprehensible and have done horrendous actions both now and in the past), giving israeli songs ratings of 0 bc of politics is one of the most idiotic things someone can do because at that point ur not critiquing music, ur just dumping ur complaints onto an unrelated medium. rating songs zero not bc they sound bad, or lack creativity, or have weak production, but because of the nationality of the artist isnt activism, its just self-righteousness disguised as engagement. Ur not helping starving Palestinians who are getting murdered by the israeli military get aid and food by bombing the aoty score of a eurovision track. ur not dismantling ooh evil zionism by giving Eden Golan a 0 on a fucking indie music forum like come on. ur just flexing ur capacity for spite in the most ineffective and idiotic way possible. If u actually care, about politics and ur stance on the conflict, then engage with the world politically: organize, protest, donate, educate. if u care about music, then rate music. don’t embarrass urself.

it's painfully obvious that this isn’t about sound or production or composition – it’s about making a point. and if it were just “i didn’t like the song,” cool, but let’s not pretend this listing of the two israeli entries to eurovision, also one adjacent to the other, was musically motivated when the only common denominator between the two is “they represent israel and came out during a war.” that’s not music criticism. that’s being a poser through ur aoty acc and it’s corny.",0,2025-05-20 02:45:02

I think what separates Billie Eilish from other Gen Z Celebrities is her music isn't made to appeal to Gen Z which is why she has more staying power compared to most of those other artists, I feel like if she pivoted more to appealing to Gen Z it would be bad for her and for her brand in general, it would alienate all the millennials who listen to her, and she naturally has Gen Z audience regardless since she's Gen Z herself, so she doesn't have to purposely appeal to her generation and can more so appeal to older people to get a bigger audience.

She knows that she doesn't have to pretend to try anymore cause she's rich anyways but Taylor Swift still puts in effort despite being a billionaire so Selena truly has no good excuse for why she doesn't try, she believes she's the only singer in the world who has mental illness and has gone through trauma, other singers have went through way worse than her and they still tried, she has no excuse for her laziness, no excuse at all, her fans can never make me love her, they truly cannot, what's to even love about this narracistic control freak?",1,2025-05-19 07:20:23
APT,Rose,all,1kppnie,"Oh great, she’s up for more awards",mt4yzt1,reddenedgalaxy,"Being blonde to me isn’t an important factor in appeal tbh. Sabrina has nice vocals and a good range and Taylor has her widespread generational appeal unlike Selena but I agree with the rest of what you said, most other millennial and Gen Z pop stars offer better vocals or dancing compared to her.",2,2025-05-19 15:39:20
APT,Rose,all,1kppnie,"Oh great, she’s up for more awards",mt3ilqj,throwaway20910167,"Omg right!! I am not a fan of Taylor at all - I think she has her fair share of problematic stuff but at least she tries! Despite her billionaire status, she puts in effort for the fans with her album releases and her latest Eras tour. Meanwhile Selena can’t even be bothered to put in effort into her music lol - heavily autotuned songs and half assed music videos. 

And personally, I never viewed her as a main pop girl even back in the 2010s. She did have some catchy hits but she isn’t in the same league as Taylor, Rihanna, Adele, Gaga, Beyoncé, etc. I don’t get why she doesn’t just retire from music, it’s not like she has the passion or the talent for it.",2,2025-05-19 10:08:05
APT,Rose,all,1kppnie,"Oh great, she’s up for more awards",mt4zjpt,DanielleLeslieAlt,"I mostly said blonde because most female pop stars are or have went blonde before and saw massive success, like Britney Spears who her fans compare her too even though they're nothing alike at all imo. Even if Selena was blonde though she would still be largely untalented I agree.",2,2025-05-19 15:42:06

Keep any longform diatribes to within the five paragraph structure. People aren't going to spend 30 minutes or an hour reading your post. If you have more to say, link to the longer form at the for those interested. Most people don't want to spend more than a few minutes reading a Reddit posts, so if you can't get your idea summarized within a 2-4 minute post, keep working on it until you can. If your essay reads like a stream of consciousness, people are going to assume you are more in line with a crazy person than a serious researcher.

If you are going to link to outside media, whether or is YouTube or peer reviewed articles or websites, use an APA citation. That clearly tells people what you are linking to as well as gives sufficient information in case the link dies.

Stop with these apparent steam of consciousness diatribes. They are unprofessional and make this sub look like a bunch of whackos. Research your point, work on your essay (including editing), condense it down to a less than five minute read, and use real citations.

neither life, this space, nor academics works the way you are describing. 

Im queering language and hence our concepts via our shiny new online tools. Its what philosophers do;) coloring outside the lines if you will. being playful with language and concepts rather than so stiff and dreary as youre describing it ought be. 

Its amazing how well this really works too:  
  
*“i'm a man on fire walking down your street*

*With one guitar and two dancing feet*

*Only one desire that's left in me*

*I want the whole damn world*

*To come dance with me*



*Oh, come dance with me over murder and pain*

*Come set you free over heartache and shame*

*I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun*

*I wanna know what we've been learning and learning from”*

Very good songs let's be real and the fact that it's probably AI is only known in communities like this and not even talked about that much. If Carti somehow did the verses on those and we wrong or if in another universe he put the effort they would be very glazed.

3. Very good song (when it released), might be the most overplayed song ever however (plays every party,club still in 2025).

4,5. Both bangers, Type Shit very overplayed but massively gaps CDHAF as far as execution goes. Eviljordan gonna be overplayed by the next 12months as well.

6. Digestible pop song made to do numbers in the mainstream + radio play, it's chill generic song that casuals enjoy.

7. ACTUALLY banger song on release but then TikTok beat this to death and when it was already dead the TikTok Rizz Party era fucked its dead body.

8,9. Both good songs with the most accessible digestible currently mainstream features, Crush just being an interlude is however disappointing (doesn't change that it's good)

10. Ultra banger that's aged very well.",99,2025-05-22 20:05:48

As far as people saying just play the 'clean' versions of dirty songs, they need to try that and see how it works out 😂.  The kids yell out the cuss words in unison so it sound like you are playing the dirty version, and the adults look at the dj booth like wtf are you doing.

FEIN,Travis Scott,all,1kr8wnb,How to deal with bratty kids at a school dance?,mtdvyqg,EXLR8_Reddit,"26 & have been doing a mix of school dance gigs since I graduated @ 17 (Proms, Middle School dances, 8th grade dinners, etc) - First off, Radio Edit / ‘Squeaky Clean edits’ are absolutely essential  in this territory. On the topic of music tho I honestly love getting to ‘push the envelope’ (within reason) when it comes to school dances. I mean if it’s just simply not appropriate or is truly a shit request then I have no problem saying “I don’t have it”, “ehhh not at a school dance” or outright “no.” 

5th grade I typically play on a even more conservative side, like I wont play ‘Carnival’ ‘Deli’ or ‘Whim Whammie‘ bc even with it being clean they’re a bit aggressive for the age-group at a school function, but imho ‘fe!n’ ‘Just wanna rock’ or ‘Nokia’ & similars should be part of the crates’ essentials. You might have to be ready to hop on the mic & tell the kids to put someone down, but it comes with the territory. 

Proms I’ll honestly pull back almost any conservatism and generally feel it out with my primary contact, if there’s a baseline of ‘do not plays’ communicated by a principle then I’d respect that, but I’m playing a Prom way closer to a club or a bar type of set than a wedding set tbh. You’ve gotta use your own discretion ofc, like no I’m not playing ‘WAP’ or ‘S&M’ (two examples from this weekend,) but as others have suggested communicate with the staff that’s hiring/in charge for a baseline if you’re totally unsure yourself. 

I had a homecoming where the principal goes, “I’ve got two requests: ‘Dreams & Nightmares’ & ‘I don’t fuck with you’” …. needless to say that was definitely a top 5 dance for that year haha",2,2025-05-20 23:38:27

When I last did a school dance 14-15 year olds - I shared a questionnaire where I asked for songs they’d like to hear and songs they did not like to hear. 
Gathered it up, checked out all of them and bucketed them in a yes/no pile. Then built a loose set with the requests sprinkled throughout. Threw in stuff that worked for 20-something’s as well and general popular dance songs from the past 5-7 years.
Worked really well. I’m not a huge fan of trap, but the generation growing up now seems to only listen to it though. But, no one danced to it - so it turned more poppy fast.",1,2025-05-20 18:08:11

There are songs that aren’t explicit that the school may have or consider inappropriate.  “Pumped Up Kicks” for example details a school shooting.  Others way reference drug use, ala Semi-charmed Kind of Life. 

That being said, yes it’s a general common rule that if a song has a “Clean” & “Explicit” versions it may be inappropriate there are some songs that could still be ok for school play with a single edit.

FEIN,Travis Scott,all,1kr8wnb,How to deal with bratty kids at a school dance?,mu87ijh,WaterIsGolden,"It places you in the role of scapegoat. 


When I was doing school parties I would get a ton of clients that would pay good money to play this game.  They don't want to say no to their spoiled child, so they book a gig and allow their child to make the must play list.  But during the gig when you play the 'clean' versions of the grimy songs on that list the parents get to pretend they didn't know their kid was a thot. 


They would pretend to be outraged at the dj for making the 'mistake' and their friends would ask them for my number so I could do their kid's party next.  


It's not just a conflict of interest for me.  It's grooming.  There are a ton of djs in this sub that avoid playing artists like R Kelly because of child exploitation, but they still play Nicki and Cardi (obviously crafted to groom underage girls).  I prefer to just pass on those gigs and play for adults.


Having a daughter opened my eyes to a lot of things that once seen cannot be unseen.  Someone else can do those grimy gigs.",2,2025-05-25 20:07:05

Atp I wouldn't be surprised if he hits up Bad Bunny or some K-pop group next as another uncreative effort to bag international viewers/charts.

Being a snake and social climbing to fulfill his dreams of being a rapper millionaire junky who fucks bitches all day is his sole purpose for making music in the first place.

The biggest downside is the lack of musicality in so many productions. So many songs are just so simple it's not like music in the past that was written by musicians who actually play instruments and had to learn music just to create something. With auto-chords, samples from places like splice, even people with no musical knowledge can create songs. So much of the electronic based music being created to today is not enduring, nobody will be listening to it much past it's viral moment, which is why I think you see the viral to nothing trend.

On the other hand, I've seen some amazing young musicians in my studio who play instruments at a top level and write interesting songs. Some of the best players I've worked with lately are Mexican regional bands who fucking shred. They've worked in a number of recording situations and really appreciate the efficiency and uncompromising quality you get in a proper studio. I think there will be a resurgence of instrument based music as people crave the human performance, as long as the mix engineer doesn't strip it away with over-editing the life away.

Back then you would have producers come see you play or other record company exec's and get feedback from them.   So the old system was the apprentice system that is missing today.

But collectively speaking, I don't think it'd be a good thing to purposefully restrict other people's ability to create, regardless of how shitty it may be. Let admirers or detractors or friends or family or the market decide that.

Enough of us humans are inherently assholes to the degree I bet you people have been bitching about other peoples' art since the dawn of man. Like it wouldn't surprise me if we found some cave painting one day of one bone flute dude shitting on some other bone flute dude's stuff lol.

Point being we, again collectively, all move art and culture forward by just making more stuff. Expression is expression whether we individually enjoy it not. I guarantee you some phenomenal achievements of human artistry were at least partially inspired by some shitty art they saw or heard. You see something or hear a song and think ""I can do that way better."" Zero artists were some completely unique minds in a vacuum; it all comes from a ton of lived experiences.

From the perspective of technology making things easier, yes, it opens the floodgates to a bunch of embarrassingly untalented people releasing music, but if that's the cost to find some wildly creative people who maybe wouldn't have had opportunities otherwise? I'll take it any day. Even if I personally never find that person, as long as someone gets to hear it, or hell, it just makes that person happy.",1,2025-05-30 19:05:04

And I didn’t say YOU want to restrict things. But if the “problem” is there’s too much music, the solution would be less music. Soo…how else does that happen. It’s gate keeping, by definition.

The more access more people have to create music, the more we as humans are likely to find and get to experience cool new shit. Yes there will be a TON of garbage but oh well. If we don’t allow ideas that are initially called “lesser” creativity room to breathe, we lose out.

Jazz and bluegrass and The Beatles were called trash by classical purists. The Ramones were trashed by plenty of rock fan and beyond. Hip-hop was trashed even by the government for fuck’s sake lol.

Your last sentence is something I see a lot, like musicians are being forced somehow into becoming influencers. No ones forcing anything. I think people have this idea like ""it used to be better"", but it wasn't better, it was just different. You paid for PR compaigns to get your work featured in mainstream media, instead of running ads on meta, or whatever.

No ones owed success. There's nothing stopping musicians writing music for themselves.

My stance on art it's it's quality in general is that it IS good if it's popular. It's bringing joy to a lot of people, that's bringing good into the world. There ARE semantic digressions regarding quality you can dig into sure, and they're interesting.

Thats the true progenitor of the entire modern gang movement with the Hoovers, Crips, Bloods, GD, et. al evolving into the modern location based sets from things like the Black Panther Party and the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s.
In some ways, Kendrick is the brainchild of the yesteryear’s Black self defense movement and the 1980’s crack era (which was started by the CIA to funnel arms to Contras in South America.)

Bro I really don't want to argue. You are free to believe what you want to believe. I feel you are in a bubble where you only see what your family or the algorithm feeds you, but that is my personal opinion and I am nobody to judge you or tell you what to think. It is up to you ✌🏽


Even the subs you've listed, I find r/geopolitics to be mostly neutral or indifferent about BJP. The other sub I don't know. Maybe you are right about it, but I have never visited it. Generally we Indians are careful not to badmouth our government in front of foreigners because it is important not to worsen the impression of our country in front of others.

It's nowhere near my name is, the real slim shady and without me, which is unfortunate , but it was an average copy with a great clip and nostalgia.
Like a lot of his newer music it lecks tempo and a musical ring to it ( which is fine, I like most of it even if im disappointed its not on the level I expect a lot of times)

Big Dawgs,Hanumankind,all,1hhhu5p,Can I create an image like this with mid journey? If not then which software? ,m2swmmx,dhbs90,"Try: ""Hyper-realistic anthropomorphic dog character with a gray pit bull head and humanoid physique, featuring chiseled abs, prominent pecs, and defined arms. The character’s skin is a smooth, light gray tone with subtle shading to highlight the muscular definition. It is wearing black shorts, standing in a dramatic pose, with a group of identical gray-toned figures blurred in the background. Intense, moody lighting enhances the gray tones and muscle contours, creating a powerful and slightly intimidating atmosphere. Highly detailed, cinematic style, 4K resolution.""",1,2024-12-19 10:14:47
